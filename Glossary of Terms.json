    "Term": "A-type Star",
    "Definition": "A star with spectral type \"A\". Astronomers identify A-type stars by the presence of strong absorption lines from hydrogen in their spectra. They have typical (effective) temperatures between around 7400 kelvins (K) and 10,000 K. Compared to other stars, they appear white or bluish white to human eyes unless affected by interstellar or atmospheric reddening. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, and Vega, the star against which all other stars' brightnesses are measured in the apparent magnitude scale, are A-type stars.",

    "Definition": "Absolute magnitude is a measure with two different definitions. Both relate to how bright objects appear under a special set of conditions. This allows the intrinsic properties of objects at different distances to be compared. This is in contrast to apparent magnitude which is a measure of how bright an object appears from the location of the observer.\n\nFor objects outside the Solar System such as stars and galaxies, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object would have when viewed from a standard distance of 10 parsecs, ignoring the effects of interstellar extinction. This standardized number allows different objects to be compared by how intrinsically bright they are.\n\nWithin the Solar System, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object such as an asteroid would have if viewed at a distance of one astronomical unit from the observer, while the object is at a distance of one astronomical unit away from the Sun, and at opposition. Note that an object in the Solar System can never match these conditions when viewed from Earth but the definition removes factors that depend on the locations of the object and the observer to allow Solar System objects in different locations to be compared.",

    "Term": "Absolute Zero",
    "Definition": "Absolute zero is the zero point of the kelvin temperature scale, corresponding to -273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale and -459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale. This choice of zero point is motivated by fundamental physics: for a classical system, the temperature of absolute zero would correspond to a state where all of the particles are at perfect rest, each with kinetic energy zero. In the real world, basic effects of quantum theory mean that this state of complete rest will never be reached.\n\nIn the language of thermodynamics, which describes general systems and their abilities to exchange heat and other forms of energy, an idealized system at temperature absolute zero would be a system from which no heat could be extracted at all. In practice, it is impossible to bring a system into that ideal state. This is codified by the so-called 3rd law of thermodynamics, also called Nernst's theorem: we can get arbitrarily close to absolute zero, but we can never reach it.",

    "Term": "Absorption Line",
    "Definition": "A rainbow forms when water droplets split light into elementary colors, from purple, blue, and green, to yellow, orange, and red. Each color corresponds to a range of wavelengths, and the rainbow colors are arranged in order of increasing wavelength from violet to red. This kind of decomposed light, or more generally of electromagnetic radiation, by wavelength is called a spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is a mixture of light particles called \"photons\". Creating a spectrum amounts to sorting photons by energy and documenting how many photons there are in each given energy range. By a basic law of quantum mechanics, this is equivalent to sorting light by frequency â€“ yet another way of documenting a spectrum.\n\nIf the amount of energy varies smoothly with wavelength (or photon energy, or frequency), the spectrum is called continuous. In contrast, sharp dips or peaks in a spectrum at certain wavelengths are called absorption and emission lines, respectively. Such lines arise due to transitions between different energy levels within atoms or molecules (or even atomic nuclei), either absorbing or emitting radiation at specific wavelengths. For example, in visible light, stars show continuous spectra with absorption lines. The lines carry information about a star's chemical composition. The analysis of spectra is known as spectroscopy; instruments that allow for the recording of spectra are called spectroscopes, spectrometers, or spectrographs.",

The measurements were consistent with the scenario for a universe where the rate of expansion was accelerating. The cause for the accelerated expansion is attributed to dark energy, the nature of which is still unknown and a topic of current research. The accelerated expansion is occurring on very large scales and has no significant effect in individual gravitationally bound galaxies.",

    "Term": "Accretion Disk",
    "Definition": "When an astrophysical object accretes matter, unless the in-falling matter is already moving straight towards the attracting object, it cannot fall directly onto it. Indeed as the in-falling object moves closer to the attracting object, the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the line between it and the attracting object increases due to conservation of angular momentum.\n\nIn many cases, in-falling matter will collect in what is called an accretion disk: a swirling disk of gas and dust surrounding the attracting object. From the inner rim of the disk, matter can fall onto the central object. For a compact central object, matter falling onto the accretion disk will have gained an enormous amount of energy while falling. As this energy is deposited in the disk, the disk can heat up to temperatures of hundreds of thousands or even millions of kelvins. Accretion disks around the supermassive black holes in the center of some galaxies provide the power for active galactic nuclei (AGN). These extremely bright objects can be brighter than all the stars in their host galaxy combined.\n\nAccretion disks are found in a variety of astrophysical situations such as around supermassive black holes, stellar remnants, gamma ray bursts, or protostars.",

It is thought to be powered by a supermassive black hole which accretes surrounding matter, forming an extremely hot accretion disk around it. AGNs have quite complex structures, with many different regions that emit light with different characteristics, and are often surrounded by a donut-shaped torus of dusty material. An AGN sometimes sends out jets of material in opposite directions. While many galaxies have a supermassive black hole in the center, not all are accreting matter and hence not all are AGN.\n\nAGN is a general term that includes objects such as quasars, blazars, Seyfert galaxies, and radio galaxies. The different observational properties of these types of objects are thought to result in part from AGNs being viewed from different angles.",

    "Term": "Adaptive Optics",
    "Definition": "When you look up at night, you might see the stars twinkle. The air in the atmosphere is always in motion, and as light from a star passes through a region with turbulence, it gets deflected by a varying amount. That is why what we can see in the sky is not a single steady point of light for each star, but a dancing, ever-changing, distorted succession of points. For astronomers, twinkling means that they cannot take images of celestial objects in as much detail as their large ground-based telescopes would otherwise allow. Adaptive optics is a way of mitigating that effect. Using either a real star or a laser-projected \"artificial star\", an adaptive optics (\"AO\") system monitors atmospheric distortion in real time. Light that has entered the telescope is guided onto a deformable mirror. Controlled by a computer, that mirror is continuously deformed in just the right way to counteract atmospheric distortion.",

That angle measures how high an object is above the horizon â€“ if you point your finger at the object, and then move that finger straight down to the horizon, the direction of your arm will have changed by the angle that is the altitude. Altitude is measured either in degrees or in radians. An object on the horizon would have an altitude of 0Â°, and an object that is directly overhead, \"at the zenith,\" would have an altitude of 90Â°. Negative altitude values are assigned to objects that are currently below the horizon â€“ there, the altitude angle measures how far the object is below the horizon. An object that is straight below your feet, \"at the nadir,\" would have an altitude of â€“90Â°.\n\nIn other contexts, such as aviation or atmospheric physics, the altitude is a measure of how high a place is above some given reference level. On Earth, altitude is often defined as the height above mean sea level. With this meaning, altitude is measured in a unit of length, such as meters.",

It makes those objects appear to move on tiny ellipses in the night sky over the course of one year, an effect known as annual parallax. The major axis of that apparent-motion ellipse, expressed as an angle, corresponds to twice the object's so-called (annual) parallax angle. The parallax angle corresponds to a change in observer position by one astronomical unit (AU), that is, by the average Earthâ€“Sun distance, or the Earth's displacement between two astronomical observations performed half a year apart.

On this scale, Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, has magnitude -1.46, and the magnitudes of the Sun and the full Moon are -26.7 and -12.7, respectively. The negative numbers indicate that these objects appear brighter than Vega. In very dark conditions, people with excellent vision can see stars up to about visual magnitude 6. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field reaches a visual magnitude near 31. This is about 100 to the power five or 10,000,000,000 times fainter than magnitude 6.",

Surveys covering small areas or \"pencil-beam\" surveys can concentrate more time observing one part of the sky and thus can detect fainter objects than some wider surveys.\n\nAstronomical surveys may cover specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as radio waves or the infrared, or may combine data from different wavelength ranges.\n\nSome astronomical surveys make repeated observations of the same part of the sky allowing the scientific study of the movement of objects across the sky and of the change in brightness of astronomical objects or the appearance of transient objects such as supernovae. By measuring the yearly change in the positions, astronomers can also calculate the distance of the objects using parallax.

Whenever the Sun is, on average, higher in the sky, more sunlight reaches a given area of ground. Over the year, this leads to warmer and cooler stretches of time, more pronounced for regions farther away from Earth's equator, which are called the seasons. Northern hemisphere seasons are opposite to southern seasons: Northern summer when the northern hemisphere is tilted maximally towards the Sun, is southern winter, with the southern hemisphere tilted away, and vice versa for southern summer. Many parts of the Earth close to the equator have seasons that are different from the summer and winter pattern seen at temperate and arctic latitudes.

To an observer on Earth, the Sun rises exactly from the cardinal point east and moves, apparently, along the line of the celestial equator during that day, setting exactly in the west. There are two equinoxes per year, one around March 20 and one around September 23.

In other words, if you draw an imaginary arc on the celestial sphere from the object to the horizon and perpendicular to the horizon, the azimuth will tell you the location of the point where this arc meets the horizon. An object located directly north would have 0 degrees azimuth, an object directly east would have 90 degrees azimuth and so on. In older textbooks used in multiple countries, the convention was to start measuring the azimuth from the south towards the west.

    "Term": "Big Bang Nucleosynthesis",
    "Definition": "Nucleosynthesis refers to processes where heavier atomic nuclei are formed from lighter ones via nuclear fusion. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), sometimes called Primordial Nucleosynthesis, is a brief instance of nucleosynthesis during our Universe's hot and dense Big Bang phase, nearly 14 billion years ago. According to our current cosmological models, BBN began in the first few seconds of the early Universe and lasted for a few minutes. The timing is directly linked to the rate at which the early Universe was expanding and cooling down. Earlier than those first seconds, the Universe had been too hot for nuclei more complex than hydrogen to survive. At the end of those few minutes, the Universe was not hot and dense enough for nuclear fusion to continue. After the end of BBN, about 25% by mass of atomic nuclei was in the form of helium-4 (a particularly stable isotope of helium), and 75% was hydrogen. Closer inspection shows that there must also have been small traces of deuterium (a hydrogen isotope), helium-3 (another helium isotope), and isotopes of lithium: lithium-6 and lithium-7. The amounts of each element produced during BBN depend only on basic cosmological parameters, and thus constitute a prediction of the cosmological models. Given that over the following nearly 14 billion years, significant additional nucleosynthesis has taken place, notably in the interiors of stars, it is a challenge to try and estimate initial element abundances from present-day observational data. For helium-4, helium-3, deuterium, and lithium-6, the cosmological BBN predictions agree very well with the reconstructions from observations. For lithium-7, there is a marked difference, but it is not clear at this time whether that indicates a problem with our understanding of BBN or a problem with the attempts to estimate the initial lithium-7 abundance.",

We see evidence of this expansion today in the Hubble Diagram.\n\nBecause our current tools do not allow astronomers to look back directly to the beginning of the Universe, much of what we understand about the Big Bang theory comes to us from mathematical models and theories. However, astronomers can study the chemical elements produced during the hot few minutes after the Big Bang (known as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis).

Their orbits follow Kepler's laws of motion and are elliptical (shaped like a squashed circle) or circular in shape.\n\nMore than half of all stars in the Milky Way are in binary systems or part of systems with more than one companion star (known as higher order multiple-star systems). Due to their enormous distances from Earth, most binary stars and higher order multiple-star systems appear to the observer as a single star.\n\nBinaries can be classified into a number of categories according to the observational method by which they were found to be binary stars. They may simultaneously belong to more than one category:\n\nVisual binaries can be observed as two separate stars close together on the sky. Not all stars that appear close on the sky (double stars) are binaries bound by gravity, some may just be close on the sky by coincidence but not bound by gravity. Double stars that are not binary stars bound by gravity can be separated by hundreds of light years in distance.\n\nSpectroscopic binaries are found due to the Doppler shift of the lines in the stars' spectrum as the stars orbit their common center of mass.\n\nEclipsing binaries can be detected when one of the component stars passes between its companion star and an observer, blocking some of the light from the companion star and causing the combined light of the system to look briefly dimmer.\n\nAstrometric binaries are systems where only one stellar image is observed â€“ either due to one of the stars being too faint to be observed or the two stars' images being blended together â€“ but where the orbital motion of the stars in the binary system causes the brightest point of the stellar image to show a periodic change in position on the sky.",

    "Definition": "In astronomy, the terms celestial body, celestial object, astronomical body, and astronomical object are used almost interchangeably as common terms for all the physical bodies and objects out there in space that astronomers study, including stars, planets, galaxies, gas clouds, and so on. Some astronomers use celestial or astronomical body in a narrower sense, namely for objects that are clearly separated from their environment â€“ in that sense, a planet would be a celestial body, a gas cloud would not be (but it would still be an astronomical object). On the smallest scales, the terms are not commonly used. A proton might reach us from outer space, but would not be commonly referred to as an astronomical object, or a celestial body.",

    "Definition": "From Earth, we perceive celestial objects as being located on a sphere, traditionally called the celestial sphere. We can describe any position on that sphere using two numbers. Every method for assigning two such numbers to a sky position is called a celestial coordinate system, and the numbers are called the object's (celestial) coordinates.\n\nOn Earth's surface, we use geographical latitude and longitude for the same purpose, and in fact one way of defining celestial coordinates is derived from that: those points in the sky that are directly above Earth's equator form the celestial equator, and the point directly above a certain location on Earth's globe is assigned numbers in a way similar to the latitude/longitude of the base point.\n\nAstronomers use different kinds of coordinate systems, including a number that takes into account Earth's daily rotation, so the coordinates are universal and are usable anywhere on Earth. This also ensures that the coordinates of, say, a star do not change significantly over timescales of days, months, or years.",

An important feature of Cepheids is that their period is closely related to their luminosity. This is the famous periodâ€“luminosity relationship revealed by Henrietta Leavitt in 1908. Using this relationship, the absolute brightness of a Cepheid can be calculated from the pulsation period. The difference between the easily observable apparent brightness and absolute brightness derived from the relationship is indicative of the distance of both the given Cepheid and the external galaxy hosting this variable star. Thus Cepheids are primary distance indicators in establishing the cosmic distance scale.",

    "Term": "Circumpolar Stars",
    "Definition": "In most locations on Earth, either the celestial North Pole or the celestial South Pole is visible in the sky at some distance above the horizon. For an observer at such a location, the stars appear to rotate around the celestial pole as time passes: Each star traces a circle in the sky, with the circle centered on the celestial pole to which Earth's axis points. At the two points where a circle crosses the observer's horizon, one eastern and the other western, the star in question will rise and set, respectively. For stars that are close enough to the celestial pole, the traced-out circle will be completely above the horizon. Our observer will never see those stars either rise or set. Those never-setting stars are called circumpolar stars.\n\nWhich stars are circumpolar depends on the observer's geographic latitude and on the star's declination â€“ the latter is the angle between the star's location and the celestial equator. In the northern hemisphere, a star is circumpolar if its declination is larger than 90Â° minus the observer's latitude. In the southern hemisphere, we need to take into account that both southern latitudes on Earth and southern declination values have a minus sign. Taking these signs into account, on the southern hemisphere, a star is circumpolar if its declination is smaller than â€“90Â° minus the observer's latitude.",

In general, a comet will have two tails: The ejected dust particles form the comet's dust tail, which has a characteristically curved shape. It is made up of dust particles released from the surface, which follow the comet along its orbit around the Sun. Dust tails can be millions of kilometers or more in length. They reflect sunlight, and if the conditions are right, their whitish, diffuse shape accounts for most of what can be observed when a comet is visible to the naked eye.\n\nA substantial fraction of the gas is blown away and ionized by the solar wind â€“ the electrically charged particles emitted by the Sun. Those ions form the comet's ion tail, which typically has a blueish color. The ion tail always points straight away from the Sun.

Naked-eye observation of our Sun's corona is possible during a total solar eclipse, when the solar corona becomes visible as a whitish, irregularly shaped area surrounding the hidden solar disk. More generally, the shape of a star's corona is determined by the star's magnetic fields and the outward pressure of gas in its upper regions. Stellar coronas have very high temperatures: At more than a million kelvins, the solar corona is much hotter than the Sun's surface. The mechanism for heating the corona to that temperature is the subject of ongoing research, but it seems clear that the magnetic fields threading the corona play a major role. The shape of the Sun's corona changes on timescales between seconds and months, mostly in response to solar activity, such as flares ejecting plasma into the corona, or coronal mass ejections releasing a considerable amount of charged particles. It also changes on a timescale of years with what is called the solar cycle â€“ the periodic change in strength and orientation of the Sun's magnetic field, with a period of nearly eleven years.

    "Definition": "Cosmic rays are energetic charged particles (e.g. protons, nuclei of heavy elements, and electrons) that move through the cosmos.\n\nCosmic rays can enter Earth's atmosphere. Primary cosmic rays could come from the Sun, Solar System, our Milky Way, or distant galaxies. They are composed of protons (about 90%), helium nuclei (about 9%), heavier atomic nuclei and electrons (about 1%), and a very small amount of antimatter. Light coming from the cosmos is not cosmic rays.\n\nIf an energetic primary cosmic ray enters the Earth's atmosphere it can interact with atmospheric particles and produce a large number of secondary charged particles, called secondary cosmic rays. The highest energy cosmic rays are nuclear particles that have kinetic energy equivalent to a tennis ball moving at about 150 kilometers per hour. However, such highest energy particles are rare and most have lower energies.",

The lunar month starts and ends at the same phase. At a phase of 0 degrees, called \"new moon,\" the Moon is as close to the Sun as it will be on that orbit. At that phase, the illuminated side of the Moon faces away from Earth, and the Moon appears dark. The size of the illuminated part of the Moon gradually increases (waxing phase) becoming a crescent. The first quarter phase (when half of the moon appears to be illuminated, this is popularly known as half moon) occurs at 90 degrees from the start point. The illuminated portion of the Moon continues to increase, becoming gibbous (convex-shaped, or bulging-shaped). Full moon occurs at 180 degrees. After this point, the shape gradually starts decreasing (waning phase), resulting in a gibbous moon, the last quarter phase (when half of the moon appears to be illuminated, this is popularly known as half moon) at 270 degrees from the start, the crescent moon, and ending as a new moon at 360 degrees.

    "Term": "Culmination",
    "Definition": "In astronomy, culmination refers to the moment where a celestial object passes through the observer's local meridian. When a celestial object in the sky crosses the meridian it is at either its highest or lowest point in the sky.\n\nFrom the observer's perspective the celestial sphere appears to rotate around the Earth. This means that celestial objects on the sky follow a circular path during the course of a day. Most objects rise in the east, move higher in the sky until they cross the meridian, and then move lower in the sky to set in the west. Circumpolar objects are objects that are close enough to one of the celestial poles that an observer could see their full circular path over one sidereal day (a little less than 24 hours). In all cases the highest point in the sky a celestial object reaches is when it crosses the meridian. The instant when it reaches this highest point is referred to as its upper culmination. Twelve (sidereal) hours later, when the object is at its lowest point in the sky (often this is below the horizon), this instant is referred to as its lower culmination.\n\nAs culmination is the moment when a celestial object crosses the observer's local meridian it is often referred to as a meridian transit or meridian passage. The hour angle on the sky is defined relative to the observer's local meridian, hence by definition upper culmination happens at an hour angle of zero and lower culmination happens at an hour angle of 12 hours.",

    "Term": "Dark Matter",
    "Definition": "Dark matter is a proposed form of matter that has mass, but is completely transparent and does not emit light. It has been postulated as a joint explanation for a variety of phenomena related to gravitational interactions.\n\nEarly evidence for the existence of dark matter came from galaxies in galaxy clusters, which were found to be moving at comparatively high speeds. Postulating additional mass served to explain why, in spite of their speeds, the galaxies in question were gravitationally bound to their cluster instead of escaping. Measurements by Vera Rubin and others of the speeds at which stars and gas orbit in disk galaxies led to a wider acceptance of the concept of dark matter: there, the usual laws of gravity require considerable mass in addition to the visible matter in order to explain the observed high rotation speeds. More recently, gravitational lensing observations have indicated considerable non-luminous mass in galaxy clusters.\n\nIn cosmology, the expansion history of the Universe points to there being more matter in the Universe than is accounted for in the form of luminous matter. The common explanation for the growth of structure in the early Universe also relies on the presence of dark matter. For these reasons, the standard cosmological models are referred to as \"Lambda CDM models\", where CDM stands for cold (slow-moving) dark matter.\n\nThe nature of dark matter is a topic of intense research and debate both in cosmology and particle physics. Evidence for dark matter remains indirect, relying on observations of the effects of dark matter's mass on luminous matter or light. Several proposals exist for species of as yet undetected elementary particles that could make up dark matter, but the experiments set up to find direct evidence for such candidate particles have not so far been successful. There are also alternative proposed explanations that claim to account for the relevant observations without the involvement of new particle species.",

    "Definition": "In English as well as in numerous other languages, \"day\" has multiple meanings. \"Day\" in the sense of \"daytime\" describes the time when the Sun provides us with natural light, followed by the night when the Sun has set, and it is dark. A day by this definition is shorter in the winter and longer in the summer in the northern hemisphere, while the opposite holds for the southern hemisphere. In the far north or the far south, there is a time of year where the Sun does not set at all â€“ directly at the poles, the Sun is up for six months without setting!\n\n\"Day\" is also the name of the 24-hour unit of time we use in the calendar. Astronomically speaking, the time from one local noon to the next â€“ that is, from the day's highest position of the Sun above the horizon from one day to the next â€“ is called an apparent solar day. The length of local days varies depending on the time of year, owing to the facts that (a) Earth's orbit is elliptical (with Earth moving faster when it is closer to the Sun), and that (b) the apparent trajectory of the Sun in the sky is at different angles relative to Earth's equator. For practical purposes, timekeeping instead uses the average length of apparent solar days, which are called mean solar days. The associated time at 24 hours per day is called mean solar time.\n\nA sidereal day is based on the \"fixed\" background stars on the celestial sphere. It is the period between the time a \"fixed\" star reaches its highest point in the sky to the next time it reaches its highest point in the sky. One sidereal day lasts approximately 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds. The discrepancy between this and an apparent solar day (24 hours) is caused by the Sun's apparent motion relative to the \"fixed\" background stars.",

Brown dwarfs are objects that have masses less than 8% of that of the Sun, and never start steady hydrogen burning in their cores â€“ a kind of intermediate class of \"substellar objects\" between the mass range of stars and that of planets.

In contrast, the equator is an imaginary line where a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis intersects with the Earth's surface at the greatest distance from the axis. The equator has a latitude of 0Â°.\n\nThe geographic poles are not at the same places as the Earth's magnetic North and South Poles â€“ the magnetic poles are defined as the locations on the surface where Earth's magnetic field points straight down and straight up, respectively.\n\nEarth's orbit has an axis as well: The direction perpendicular to Earth's orbital plane. Earth's axis is inclined by an angle of 23.4Â° against that orbital axis. This tilt is the cause of Earth's seasons. In particular, over the course of one orbit, there are phases where the northern hemisphere or the southern one are tilted toward the Sun, thus receiving more light.\n\nRelative to the most distant celestial objects, the direction Earth's axis points towards changes slowly over time, in what is called Earth's axial precession. Currently, the Earth's axis intersects the celestial sphere close to Polaris, the North Star. But over roughly 26,000 years, that intersection point describes a small circle in the sky.

The simplest case is that of a body that is spherically symmetric â€“ which is an excellent approximation for describing stars and planets. In this case, the escape velocity at a distance r from the center of a body of mass m, is given by âˆš(2Gm/r), where G is the gravitational constant. At the surface of a spherical body the distance from its center is its radius. This means that the escape velocity at the surface of an approximately spherical celestial body depends on the radius and its mass. In the case of the Sun, it is 617.5 kilometers per second (km/s), and for Earth, 11.2 km/s. It is 2.4 km/s for the Moon, which means that an object on the Moon needs to attain a lower speed to escape the Moon's gravity than an object on Earth would need to leave Earth's gravity.",

    "Definition": "Extraterrestrial intelligence refers to the possible existence of intelligent entities other than those on Earth.\n\nSearches for extraterrestrial intelligence have included looking for radio or other signals, but much current research is centered on determining whether the conditions for intelligent life are present elsewhere. Going by the available evidence, the necessary conditions for the emergence of life on Earth â€“ a solid planet, at a distance from its star where liquid water can exist on the planet's surface, atoms like carbon and oxygen, and the conditions to form more complex molecules â€“ should exist on numerous other planets within our Galaxy and beyond. It is not an unreasonable assumption that intelligent life might have arisen at least on some of those planets, although we have no solid basis for estimating the probability of that happening.\n\nSome astronomers have used radio signals to search for putative messages as part of a Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). The speed of light as a fundamental physical limit means that interstellar journeys would take very long times, limiting the ability for us to come into direct contact with extraterrestrial intelligences.",

    "Definition": "Extraterrestrial life or alien life refers to forms of life that may occur outside Earth and which did not originate on Earth.\n\nAlthough not even simple forms of extraterrestrial life have been detected to date, it is likely that life has similarly arisen on some of the billions and billions of exoplanets in our galaxy. Astronomers estimate that, on average, each star in our galaxy has more than one planet. A number of these exoplanets are expected to offer conditions similar to those that allowed life to arise here on Earth, in particular liquid water.\n\nJust as on Earth, the presence of certain kinds of life is expected to significantly alter the chemical composition of such a planet's atmosphere, and a major goal of astronomy for the coming decades is to detect the presence of life by studying distant planetary atmospheres. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, on the other hand, has long been searching for possible radio signals from intelligent life on other worlds. In our own Solar System, conditions in the ice-covered oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus, might allow for life.",

They have typical (effective) temperatures between around 6000 kelvins (K) and 7400 K. Compared to other stars, they appear white or yellowish white to human eyes unless interstellar or atmospheric reddening is important. Polaris (the North Star) is an example of an F-type star.",
