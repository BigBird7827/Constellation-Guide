    "Term": "A-type Star",
    "Definition": "A star with spectral type \"A\". Astronomers identify A-type stars by the presence of strong absorption lines from hydrogen in their spectra. They have typical (effective) temperatures between around 7400 kelvins (K) and 10,000 K. Compared to other stars, they appear white or bluish white to human eyes unless affected by interstellar or atmospheric reddening. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, and Vega, the star against which all other stars' brightnesses are measured in the apparent magnitude scale, are A-type stars.",

    "Term": "Absolute Magnitude",
    "Definition": "Absolute magnitude is a measure with two different definitions. Both relate to how bright objects appear under a special set of conditions. This allows the intrinsic properties of objects at different distances to be compared. This is in contrast to apparent magnitude which is a measure of how bright an object appears from the location of the observer.\n\nFor objects outside the Solar System such as stars and galaxies, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object would have when viewed from a standard distance of 10 parsecs, ignoring the effects of interstellar extinction. This standardized number allows different objects to be compared by how intrinsically bright they are.\n\nWithin the Solar System, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object such as an asteroid would have if viewed at a distance of one astronomical unit from the observer, while the object is at a distance of one astronomical unit away from the Sun, and at opposition. Note that an object in the Solar System can never match these conditions when viewed from Earth but the definition removes factors that depend on the locations of the object and the observer to allow Solar System objects in different locations to be compared.",

    "Term": "Absolute Zero",
    "Definition": "Absolute zero is the zero point of the kelvin temperature scale, corresponding to -273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale and -459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale. This choice of zero point is motivated by fundamental physics: for a classical system, the temperature of absolute zero would correspond to a state where all of the particles are at perfect rest, each with kinetic energy zero. In the real world, basic effects of quantum theory mean that this state of complete rest will never be reached.\n\nIn the language of thermodynamics, which describes general systems and their abilities to exchange heat and other forms of energy, an idealized system at temperature absolute zero would be a system from which no heat could be extracted at all. In practice, it is impossible to bring a system into that ideal state. This is codified by the so-called 3rd law of thermodynamics, also called Nernst's theorem: we can get arbitrarily close to absolute zero, but we can never reach it.",

    "Term": "Absorption Line",
    "Definition": "A rainbow forms when water droplets split light into elementary colors, from purple, blue, and green, to yellow, orange, and red. Each color corresponds to a range of wavelengths, and the rainbow colors are arranged in order of increasing wavelength from violet to red. This kind of decomposed light, or more generally of electromagnetic radiation, by wavelength is called a spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is a mixture of light particles called \"photons\". Creating a spectrum amounts to sorting photons by energy and documenting how many photons there are in each given energy range. By a basic law of quantum mechanics, this is equivalent to sorting light by frequency â€“ yet another way of documenting a spectrum.\n\nIf the amount of energy varies smoothly with wavelength (or photon energy, or frequency), the spectrum is called continuous. In contrast, sharp dips or peaks in a spectrum at certain wavelengths are called absorption and emission lines, respectively. Such lines arise due to transitions between different energy levels within atoms or molecules (or even atomic nuclei), either absorbing or emitting radiation at specific wavelengths. For example, in visible light, stars show continuous spectra with absorption lines. The lines carry information about a star's chemical composition. The analysis of spectra is known as spectroscopy; instruments that allow for the recording of spectra are called spectroscopes, spectrometers, or spectrographs.",

    "Term": "Accelerating Universe",
    "Definition": "In the late 1990s, measurements of the light emitted from Type Ia supernovae (a class of exploding star), located in very distant galaxies showed that they appeared fainter than expected for a universe with a constant rate (speed) of expansion. The measurements were consistent with the scenario for a universe where the rate of expansion was accelerating. The cause for the accelerated expansion is attributed to dark energy, the nature of which is still unknown and a topic of current research. The accelerated expansion is occurring on very large scales and has no significant effect in individual gravitationally bound galaxies.",

    "Term": "Accretion",
    "Definition": "Accretion is the process of an astrophysical object attracting additional matter, typically gas or dust, by its gravitational pull. Accretion happens in many different astronomical scenarios including (but not limited to): gas accreting onto a black hole, stars in binary systems accreting matter from their companion, young stars accreting gas from a disk of material surrounding them, and galaxies accreting stars from other galaxies.",

  {
    "Term": "Accretion Disk",
    "Definition": "When an astrophysical object accretes matter, unless the in-falling matter is already moving straight towards the attracting object, it cannot fall directly onto it. Indeed as the in-falling object moves closer to the attracting object, the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the line between it and the attracting object increases due to conservation of angular momentum.\n\nIn many cases, in-falling matter will collect in what is called an accretion disk: a swirling disk of gas and dust surrounding the attracting object. From the inner rim of the disk, matter can fall onto the central object. For a compact central object, matter falling onto the accretion disk will have gained an enormous amount of energy while falling. As this energy is deposited in the disk, the disk can heat up to temperatures of hundreds of thousands or even millions of kelvins. Accretion disks around the supermassive black holes in the center of some galaxies provide the power for active galactic nuclei (AGN). These extremely bright objects can be brighter than all the stars in their host galaxy combined.\n\nAccretion disks are found in a variety of astrophysical situations such as around supermassive black holes, stellar remnants, gamma ray bursts, or protostars.",

    "Term": "Active Galactic Nucleus",
    "Definition": "An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a very luminous region at the center of a galaxy. It is thought to be powered by a supermassive black hole which accretes surrounding matter, forming an extremely hot accretion disk around it. AGNs have quite complex structures, with many different regions that emit light with different characteristics, and are often surrounded by a donut-shaped torus of dusty material. An AGN sometimes sends out jets of material in opposite directions. While many galaxies have a supermassive black hole in the center, not all are accreting matter and hence not all are AGN.\n\nAGN is a general term that includes objects such as quasars, blazars, Seyfert galaxies, and radio galaxies. The different observational properties of these types of objects are thought to result in part from AGNs being viewed from different angles.",

    "Term": "Adaptive Optics",
    "Definition": "When you look up at night, you might see the stars twinkle. The air in the atmosphere is always in motion, and as light from a star passes through a region with turbulence, it gets deflected by a varying amount. That is why what we can see in the sky is not a single steady point of light for each star, but a dancing, ever-changing, distorted succession of points. For astronomers, twinkling means that they cannot take images of celestial objects in as much detail as their large ground-based telescopes would otherwise allow. Adaptive optics is a way of mitigating that effect. Using either a real star or a laser-projected \"artificial star\", an adaptive optics (\"AO\") system monitors atmospheric distortion in real time. Light that has entered the telescope is guided onto a deformable mirror. Controlled by a computer, that mirror is continuously deformed in just the right way to counteract atmospheric distortion.",

At the time of writing, there is one confirmed planet that orbits Proxima Centauri. It has been designated Proxima Centauri b, and its orbit is in the so-called habitable zone of the star. Two additional candidates for planets, Proxima Centauri c and d, have not yet been confirmed.

    "Definition": "Altitude has two meanings: it denotes either a specific angle in a certain type of coordinate system (\"the altitude of a star\") or a vertical distance relative to a given reference level (\"5000 m above sea level\").\n\nIn astronomy (and surveying), altitude is an angle in so-called horizontal coordinate systems. That angle measures how high an object is above the horizon â€“ if you point your finger at the object, and then move that finger straight down to the horizon, the direction of your arm will have changed by the angle that is the altitude. Altitude is measured either in degrees or in radians. An object on the horizon would have an altitude of 0Â°, and an object that is directly overhead, \"at the zenith,\" would have an altitude of 90Â°. Negative altitude values are assigned to objects that are currently below the horizon â€“ there, the altitude angle measures how far the object is below the horizon. An object that is straight below your feet, \"at the nadir,\" would have an altitude of â€“90Â°.\n\nIn other contexts, such as aviation or atmospheric physics, the altitude is a measure of how high a place is above some given reference level. On Earth, altitude is often defined as the height above mean sea level. With this meaning, altitude is measured in a unit of length, such as meters.",

It can also be thought of as the spread of a point-like object (such as a star), that is mainly due to optics of the telescope. This is a very important characteristic of telescopes, as telescopes with higher angular resolution enable us to visually separate stars seen very close to each other as well as to see finer details in extended objects such as nebulae and galaxies. Two stars with angular separation smaller than the resolution will appear as a single object. The resolution of a telescope can be improved by increasing the size of its light collecting mirror or lens. It also depends on the wavelength and becomes poorer as the wavelength increases.",
