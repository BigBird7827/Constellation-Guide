    "Term": "A-type Star",
    "Definition": "A star with spectral type \"A\". Astronomers identify A-type stars by the presence of strong absorption lines from hydrogen in their spectra. They have typical (effective) temperatures between around 7400 kelvins (K) and 10,000 K. Compared to other stars, they appear white or bluish white to human eyes unless affected by interstellar or atmospheric reddening. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, and Vega, the star against which all other stars' brightnesses are measured in the apparent magnitude scale, are A-type stars.",

    "Term": "Absolute Magnitude",
    "Definition": "Absolute magnitude is a measure with two different definitions. Both relate to how bright objects appear under a special set of conditions. This allows the intrinsic properties of objects at different distances to be compared. This is in contrast to apparent magnitude which is a measure of how bright an object appears from the location of the observer.\n\nFor objects outside the Solar System such as stars and galaxies, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object would have when viewed from a standard distance of 10 parsecs, ignoring the effects of interstellar extinction. This standardized number allows different objects to be compared by how intrinsically bright they are.\n\nWithin the Solar System, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object such as an asteroid would have if viewed at a distance of one astronomical unit from the observer, while the object is at a distance of one astronomical unit away from the Sun, and at opposition. Note that an object in the Solar System can never match these conditions when viewed from Earth but the definition removes factors that depend on the locations of the object and the observer to allow Solar System objects in different locations to be compared.",

    "Term": "Absolute Zero",
    "Definition": "Absolute zero is the zero point of the kelvin temperature scale, corresponding to -273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale and -459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale. This choice of zero point is motivated by fundamental physics: for a classical system, the temperature of absolute zero would correspond to a state where all of the particles are at perfect rest, each with kinetic energy zero. In the real world, basic effects of quantum theory mean that this state of complete rest will never be reached.\n\nIn the language of thermodynamics, which describes general systems and their abilities to exchange heat and other forms of energy, an idealized system at temperature absolute zero would be a system from which no heat could be extracted at all. In practice, it is impossible to bring a system into that ideal state. This is codified by the so-called 3rd law of thermodynamics, also called Nernst's theorem: we can get arbitrarily close to absolute zero, but we can never reach it.",

    "Term": "Absorption Line",
    "Definition": "A rainbow forms when water droplets split light into elementary colors, from purple, blue, and green, to yellow, orange, and red. Each color corresponds to a range of wavelengths, and the rainbow colors are arranged in order of increasing wavelength from violet to red. This kind of decomposed light, or more generally of electromagnetic radiation, by wavelength is called a spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is a mixture of light particles called \"photons\". Creating a spectrum amounts to sorting photons by energy and documenting how many photons there are in each given energy range. By a basic law of quantum mechanics, this is equivalent to sorting light by frequency – yet another way of documenting a spectrum.\n\nIf the amount of energy varies smoothly with wavelength (or photon energy, or frequency), the spectrum is called continuous. In contrast, sharp dips or peaks in a spectrum at certain wavelengths are called absorption and emission lines, respectively. Such lines arise due to transitions between different energy levels within atoms or molecules (or even atomic nuclei), either absorbing or emitting radiation at specific wavelengths. For example, in visible light, stars show continuous spectra with absorption lines. The lines carry information about a star's chemical composition. The analysis of spectra is known as spectroscopy; instruments that allow for the recording of spectra are called spectroscopes, spectrometers, or spectrographs.",

The measurements were consistent with the scenario for a universe where the rate of expansion was accelerating. The cause for the accelerated expansion is attributed to dark energy, the nature of which is still unknown and a topic of current research. The accelerated expansion is occurring on very large scales and has no significant effect in individual gravitationally bound galaxies.",

    "Term": "Accretion Disk",
    "Definition": "When an astrophysical object accretes matter, unless the in-falling matter is already moving straight towards the attracting object, it cannot fall directly onto it. Indeed as the in-falling object moves closer to the attracting object, the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the line between it and the attracting object increases due to conservation of angular momentum.\n\nIn many cases, in-falling matter will collect in what is called an accretion disk: a swirling disk of gas and dust surrounding the attracting object. From the inner rim of the disk, matter can fall onto the central object. For a compact central object, matter falling onto the accretion disk will have gained an enormous amount of energy while falling. As this energy is deposited in the disk, the disk can heat up to temperatures of hundreds of thousands or even millions of kelvins. Accretion disks around the supermassive black holes in the center of some galaxies provide the power for active galactic nuclei (AGN). These extremely bright objects can be brighter than all the stars in their host galaxy combined.\n\nAccretion disks are found in a variety of astrophysical situations such as around supermassive black holes, stellar remnants, gamma ray bursts, or protostars.",

It is thought to be powered by a supermassive black hole which accretes surrounding matter, forming an extremely hot accretion disk around it. AGNs have quite complex structures, with many different regions that emit light with different characteristics, and are often surrounded by a donut-shaped torus of dusty material. An AGN sometimes sends out jets of material in opposite directions. While many galaxies have a supermassive black hole in the center, not all are accreting matter and hence not all are AGN.\n\nAGN is a general term that includes objects such as quasars, blazars, Seyfert galaxies, and radio galaxies. The different observational properties of these types of objects are thought to result in part from AGNs being viewed from different angles.",

    "Term": "Adaptive Optics",
    "Definition": "When you look up at night, you might see the stars twinkle. The air in the atmosphere is always in motion, and as light from a star passes through a region with turbulence, it gets deflected by a varying amount. That is why what we can see in the sky is not a single steady point of light for each star, but a dancing, ever-changing, distorted succession of points. For astronomers, twinkling means that they cannot take images of celestial objects in as much detail as their large ground-based telescopes would otherwise allow. Adaptive optics is a way of mitigating that effect. Using either a real star or a laser-projected \"artificial star\", an adaptive optics (\"AO\") system monitors atmospheric distortion in real time. Light that has entered the telescope is guided onto a deformable mirror. Controlled by a computer, that mirror is continuously deformed in just the right way to counteract atmospheric distortion.",

That angle measures how high an object is above the horizon – if you point your finger at the object, and then move that finger straight down to the horizon, the direction of your arm will have changed by the angle that is the altitude. Altitude is measured either in degrees or in radians. An object on the horizon would have an altitude of 0°, and an object that is directly overhead, \"at the zenith,\" would have an altitude of 90°. Negative altitude values are assigned to objects that are currently below the horizon – there, the altitude angle measures how far the object is below the horizon. An object that is straight below your feet, \"at the nadir,\" would have an altitude of –90°.\n\nIn other contexts, such as aviation or atmospheric physics, the altitude is a measure of how high a place is above some given reference level. On Earth, altitude is often defined as the height above mean sea level. With this meaning, altitude is measured in a unit of length, such as meters.",

It makes those objects appear to move on tiny ellipses in the night sky over the course of one year, an effect known as annual parallax. The major axis of that apparent-motion ellipse, expressed as an angle, corresponds to twice the object's so-called (annual) parallax angle. The parallax angle corresponds to a change in observer position by one astronomical unit (AU), that is, by the average Earth–Sun distance, or the Earth's displacement between two astronomical observations performed half a year apart.

On this scale, Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, has magnitude -1.46, and the magnitudes of the Sun and the full Moon are -26.7 and -12.7, respectively. The negative numbers indicate that these objects appear brighter than Vega. In very dark conditions, people with excellent vision can see stars up to about visual magnitude 6. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field reaches a visual magnitude near 31. This is about 100 to the power five or 10,000,000,000 times fainter than magnitude 6.",

If heating by the Sun or star causes the small body to emit gas and dust, the body is a comet and not an asteroid (although the distinction is not always clear).\n\nHistorically, the name asteroid was given to any astronomical body that orbits the Sun that was too small to resolve with a telescope.

Surveys covering small areas or \"pencil-beam\" surveys can concentrate more time observing one part of the sky and thus can detect fainter objects than some wider surveys.\n\nAstronomical surveys may cover specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as radio waves or the infrared, or may combine data from different wavelength ranges.\n\nSome astronomical surveys make repeated observations of the same part of the sky allowing the scientific study of the movement of objects across the sky and of the change in brightness of astronomical objects or the appearance of transient objects such as supernovae. By measuring the yearly change in the positions, astronomers can also calculate the distance of the objects using parallax.

Whenever the Sun is, on average, higher in the sky, more sunlight reaches a given area of ground. Over the year, this leads to warmer and cooler stretches of time, more pronounced for regions farther away from Earth's equator, which are called the seasons. Northern hemisphere seasons are opposite to southern seasons: Northern summer when the northern hemisphere is tilted maximally towards the Sun, is southern winter, with the southern hemisphere tilted away, and vice versa for southern summer. Many parts of the Earth close to the equator have seasons that are different from the summer and winter pattern seen at temperate and arctic latitudes.

To an observer on Earth, the Sun rises exactly from the cardinal point east and moves, apparently, along the line of the celestial equator during that day, setting exactly in the west. There are two equinoxes per year, one around March 20 and one around September 23.

In other words, if you draw an imaginary arc on the celestial sphere from the object to the horizon and perpendicular to the horizon, the azimuth will tell you the location of the point where this arc meets the horizon. An object located directly north would have 0 degrees azimuth, an object directly east would have 90 degrees azimuth and so on. In older textbooks used in multiple countries, the convention was to start measuring the azimuth from the south towards the west.

    "Term": "Big Bang Nucleosynthesis",
    "Definition": "Nucleosynthesis refers to processes where heavier atomic nuclei are formed from lighter ones via nuclear fusion. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), sometimes called Primordial Nucleosynthesis, is a brief instance of nucleosynthesis during our Universe's hot and dense Big Bang phase, nearly 14 billion years ago. According to our current cosmological models, BBN began in the first few seconds of the early Universe and lasted for a few minutes. The timing is directly linked to the rate at which the early Universe was expanding and cooling down. Earlier than those first seconds, the Universe had been too hot for nuclei more complex than hydrogen to survive. At the end of those few minutes, the Universe was not hot and dense enough for nuclear fusion to continue. After the end of BBN, about 25% by mass of atomic nuclei was in the form of helium-4 (a particularly stable isotope of helium), and 75% was hydrogen. Closer inspection shows that there must also have been small traces of deuterium (a hydrogen isotope), helium-3 (another helium isotope), and isotopes of lithium: lithium-6 and lithium-7. The amounts of each element produced during BBN depend only on basic cosmological parameters, and thus constitute a prediction of the cosmological models. Given that over the following nearly 14 billion years, significant additional nucleosynthesis has taken place, notably in the interiors of stars, it is a challenge to try and estimate initial element abundances from present-day observational data. For helium-4, helium-3, deuterium, and lithium-6, the cosmological BBN predictions agree very well with the reconstructions from observations. For lithium-7, there is a marked difference, but it is not clear at this time whether that indicates a problem with our understanding of BBN or a problem with the attempts to estimate the initial lithium-7 abundance.",

We see evidence of this expansion today in the Hubble Diagram.\n\nBecause our current tools do not allow astronomers to look back directly to the beginning of the Universe, much of what we understand about the Big Bang theory comes to us from mathematical models and theories. However, astronomers can study the chemical elements produced during the hot few minutes after the Big Bang (known as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis).

Their orbits follow Kepler's laws of motion and are elliptical (shaped like a squashed circle) or circular in shape.\n\nMore than half of all stars in the Milky Way are in binary systems or part of systems with more than one companion star (known as higher order multiple-star systems). Due to their enormous distances from Earth, most binary stars and higher order multiple-star systems appear to the observer as a single star.\n\nBinaries can be classified into a number of categories according to the observational method by which they were found to be binary stars. They may simultaneously belong to more than one category:\n\nVisual binaries can be observed as two separate stars close together on the sky. Not all stars that appear close on the sky (double stars) are binaries bound by gravity, some may just be close on the sky by coincidence but not bound by gravity. Double stars that are not binary stars bound by gravity can be separated by hundreds of light years in distance.\n\nSpectroscopic binaries are found due to the Doppler shift of the lines in the stars' spectrum as the stars orbit their common center of mass.\n\nEclipsing binaries can be detected when one of the component stars passes between its companion star and an observer, blocking some of the light from the companion star and causing the combined light of the system to look briefly dimmer.\n\nAstrometric binaries are systems where only one stellar image is observed – either due to one of the stars being too faint to be observed or the two stars' images being blended together – but where the orbital motion of the stars in the binary system causes the brightest point of the stellar image to show a periodic change in position on the sky.",

    "Definition": "In astronomy, the terms celestial body, celestial object, astronomical body, and astronomical object are used almost interchangeably as common terms for all the physical bodies and objects out there in space that astronomers study, including stars, planets, galaxies, gas clouds, and so on. Some astronomers use celestial or astronomical body in a narrower sense, namely for objects that are clearly separated from their environment – in that sense, a planet would be a celestial body, a gas cloud would not be (but it would still be an astronomical object). On the smallest scales, the terms are not commonly used. A proton might reach us from outer space, but would not be commonly referred to as an astronomical object, or a celestial body.",

    "Definition": "From Earth, we perceive celestial objects as being located on a sphere, traditionally called the celestial sphere. We can describe any position on that sphere using two numbers. Every method for assigning two such numbers to a sky position is called a celestial coordinate system, and the numbers are called the object's (celestial) coordinates.\n\nOn Earth's surface, we use geographical latitude and longitude for the same purpose, and in fact one way of defining celestial coordinates is derived from that: those points in the sky that are directly above Earth's equator form the celestial equator, and the point directly above a certain location on Earth's globe is assigned numbers in a way similar to the latitude/longitude of the base point.\n\nAstronomers use different kinds of coordinate systems, including a number that takes into account Earth's daily rotation, so the coordinates are universal and are usable anywhere on Earth. This also ensures that the coordinates of, say, a star do not change significantly over timescales of days, months, or years.",

An important feature of Cepheids is that their period is closely related to their luminosity. This is the famous period–luminosity relationship revealed by Henrietta Leavitt in 1908. Using this relationship, the absolute brightness of a Cepheid can be calculated from the pulsation period. The difference between the easily observable apparent brightness and absolute brightness derived from the relationship is indicative of the distance of both the given Cepheid and the external galaxy hosting this variable star. Thus Cepheids are primary distance indicators in establishing the cosmic distance scale.",

    "Term": "Circumpolar Stars",
    "Definition": "In most locations on Earth, either the celestial North Pole or the celestial South Pole is visible in the sky at some distance above the horizon. For an observer at such a location, the stars appear to rotate around the celestial pole as time passes: Each star traces a circle in the sky, with the circle centered on the celestial pole to which Earth's axis points. At the two points where a circle crosses the observer's horizon, one eastern and the other western, the star in question will rise and set, respectively. For stars that are close enough to the celestial pole, the traced-out circle will be completely above the horizon. Our observer will never see those stars either rise or set. Those never-setting stars are called circumpolar stars.\n\nWhich stars are circumpolar depends on the observer's geographic latitude and on the star's declination – the latter is the angle between the star's location and the celestial equator. In the northern hemisphere, a star is circumpolar if its declination is larger than 90° minus the observer's latitude. In the southern hemisphere, we need to take into account that both southern latitudes on Earth and southern declination values have a minus sign. Taking these signs into account, on the southern hemisphere, a star is circumpolar if its declination is smaller than –90° minus the observer's latitude.",

In general, a comet will have two tails: The ejected dust particles form the comet's dust tail, which has a characteristically curved shape. It is made up of dust particles released from the surface, which follow the comet along its orbit around the Sun. Dust tails can be millions of kilometers or more in length. They reflect sunlight, and if the conditions are right, their whitish, diffuse shape accounts for most of what can be observed when a comet is visible to the naked eye.\n\nA substantial fraction of the gas is blown away and ionized by the solar wind – the electrically charged particles emitted by the Sun. Those ions form the comet's ion tail, which typically has a blueish color. The ion tail always points straight away from the Sun.

Naked-eye observation of our Sun's corona is possible during a total solar eclipse, when the solar corona becomes visible as a whitish, irregularly shaped area surrounding the hidden solar disk. More generally, the shape of a star's corona is determined by the star's magnetic fields and the outward pressure of gas in its upper regions. Stellar coronas have very high temperatures: At more than a million kelvins, the solar corona is much hotter than the Sun's surface. The mechanism for heating the corona to that temperature is the subject of ongoing research, but it seems clear that the magnetic fields threading the corona play a major role. The shape of the Sun's corona changes on timescales between seconds and months, mostly in response to solar activity, such as flares ejecting plasma into the corona, or coronal mass ejections releasing a considerable amount of charged particles. It also changes on a timescale of years with what is called the solar cycle – the periodic change in strength and orientation of the Sun's magnetic field, with a period of nearly eleven years.

    "Definition": "Cosmic rays are energetic charged particles (e.g. protons, nuclei of heavy elements, and electrons) that move through the cosmos.\n\nCosmic rays can enter Earth's atmosphere. Primary cosmic rays could come from the Sun, Solar System, our Milky Way, or distant galaxies. They are composed of protons (about 90%), helium nuclei (about 9%), heavier atomic nuclei and electrons (about 1%), and a very small amount of antimatter. Light coming from the cosmos is not cosmic rays.\n\nIf an energetic primary cosmic ray enters the Earth's atmosphere it can interact with atmospheric particles and produce a large number of secondary charged particles, called secondary cosmic rays. The highest energy cosmic rays are nuclear particles that have kinetic energy equivalent to a tennis ball moving at about 150 kilometers per hour. However, such highest energy particles are rare and most have lower energies.",

The lunar month starts and ends at the same phase. At a phase of 0 degrees, called \"new moon,\" the Moon is as close to the Sun as it will be on that orbit. At that phase, the illuminated side of the Moon faces away from Earth, and the Moon appears dark. The size of the illuminated part of the Moon gradually increases (waxing phase) becoming a crescent. The first quarter phase (when half of the moon appears to be illuminated, this is popularly known as half moon) occurs at 90 degrees from the start point. The illuminated portion of the Moon continues to increase, becoming gibbous (convex-shaped, or bulging-shaped). Full moon occurs at 180 degrees. After this point, the shape gradually starts decreasing (waning phase), resulting in a gibbous moon, the last quarter phase (when half of the moon appears to be illuminated, this is popularly known as half moon) at 270 degrees from the start, the crescent moon, and ending as a new moon at 360 degrees.

    "Term": "Culmination",
    "Definition": "In astronomy, culmination refers to the moment where a celestial object passes through the observer's local meridian. When a celestial object in the sky crosses the meridian it is at either its highest or lowest point in the sky.\n\nFrom the observer's perspective the celestial sphere appears to rotate around the Earth. This means that celestial objects on the sky follow a circular path during the course of a day. Most objects rise in the east, move higher in the sky until they cross the meridian, and then move lower in the sky to set in the west. Circumpolar objects are objects that are close enough to one of the celestial poles that an observer could see their full circular path over one sidereal day (a little less than 24 hours). In all cases the highest point in the sky a celestial object reaches is when it crosses the meridian. The instant when it reaches this highest point is referred to as its upper culmination. Twelve (sidereal) hours later, when the object is at its lowest point in the sky (often this is below the horizon), this instant is referred to as its lower culmination.\n\nAs culmination is the moment when a celestial object crosses the observer's local meridian it is often referred to as a meridian transit or meridian passage. The hour angle on the sky is defined relative to the observer's local meridian, hence by definition upper culmination happens at an hour angle of zero and lower culmination happens at an hour angle of 12 hours.",

    "Term": "Dark Matter",
    "Definition": "Dark matter is a proposed form of matter that has mass, but is completely transparent and does not emit light. It has been postulated as a joint explanation for a variety of phenomena related to gravitational interactions.\n\nEarly evidence for the existence of dark matter came from galaxies in galaxy clusters, which were found to be moving at comparatively high speeds. Postulating additional mass served to explain why, in spite of their speeds, the galaxies in question were gravitationally bound to their cluster instead of escaping. Measurements by Vera Rubin and others of the speeds at which stars and gas orbit in disk galaxies led to a wider acceptance of the concept of dark matter: there, the usual laws of gravity require considerable mass in addition to the visible matter in order to explain the observed high rotation speeds. More recently, gravitational lensing observations have indicated considerable non-luminous mass in galaxy clusters.\n\nIn cosmology, the expansion history of the Universe points to there being more matter in the Universe than is accounted for in the form of luminous matter. The common explanation for the growth of structure in the early Universe also relies on the presence of dark matter. For these reasons, the standard cosmological models are referred to as \"Lambda CDM models\", where CDM stands for cold (slow-moving) dark matter.\n\nThe nature of dark matter is a topic of intense research and debate both in cosmology and particle physics. Evidence for dark matter remains indirect, relying on observations of the effects of dark matter's mass on luminous matter or light. Several proposals exist for species of as yet undetected elementary particles that could make up dark matter, but the experiments set up to find direct evidence for such candidate particles have not so far been successful. There are also alternative proposed explanations that claim to account for the relevant observations without the involvement of new particle species.",

    "Definition": "In English as well as in numerous other languages, \"day\" has multiple meanings. \"Day\" in the sense of \"daytime\" describes the time when the Sun provides us with natural light, followed by the night when the Sun has set, and it is dark. A day by this definition is shorter in the winter and longer in the summer in the northern hemisphere, while the opposite holds for the southern hemisphere. In the far north or the far south, there is a time of year where the Sun does not set at all – directly at the poles, the Sun is up for six months without setting!\n\n\"Day\" is also the name of the 24-hour unit of time we use in the calendar. Astronomically speaking, the time from one local noon to the next – that is, from the day's highest position of the Sun above the horizon from one day to the next – is called an apparent solar day. The length of local days varies depending on the time of year, owing to the facts that (a) Earth's orbit is elliptical (with Earth moving faster when it is closer to the Sun), and that (b) the apparent trajectory of the Sun in the sky is at different angles relative to Earth's equator. For practical purposes, timekeeping instead uses the average length of apparent solar days, which are called mean solar days. The associated time at 24 hours per day is called mean solar time.\n\nA sidereal day is based on the \"fixed\" background stars on the celestial sphere. It is the period between the time a \"fixed\" star reaches its highest point in the sky to the next time it reaches its highest point in the sky. One sidereal day lasts approximately 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds. The discrepancy between this and an apparent solar day (24 hours) is caused by the Sun's apparent motion relative to the \"fixed\" background stars.",

    "Definition": "A dwarf galaxy is a small galaxy that is unusually faint either because of its very small size, or its very low surface brightness, or both. Typically, dwarf galaxies are at most as luminous as a billion times the solar luminosity, corresponding to less than one percent of the luminosity of our own home galaxy, the Milky Way. There are numerous different types of dwarf galaxy including dwarf ellipticals, dwarf spheroidals, dwarf spirals, and dwarf irregular galaxies. One of the most important examples of dwarf galaxies is the Small Magellanic Cloud, which is a dwarf irregular satellite of our home galaxy, the Milky Way.",

Typically, when astronomers refer to such main sequence stars, they include a reference to the color, such as \"red dwarf\" for the most common, low-mass dwarf stars, or \"yellow dwarf\" for stars like our Sun.\n\nCaution: In astronomy, there are cases where the designation \"dwarf\" refers to objects that are not dwarf stars by this definition! Brown dwarfs are objects that have masses less than 8% of that of the Sun, and never start steady hydrogen burning in their cores – a kind of intermediate class of \"substellar objects\" between the mass range of stars and that of planets. White dwarfs, also called white dwarf stars, are the compact remnants of low to medium mass stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel.

In contrast, the equator is an imaginary line where a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis intersects with the Earth's surface at the greatest distance from the axis. The equator has a latitude of 0°.\n\nThe geographic poles are not at the same places as the Earth's magnetic North and South Poles – the magnetic poles are defined as the locations on the surface where Earth's magnetic field points straight down and straight up, respectively.\n\nEarth's orbit has an axis as well: The direction perpendicular to Earth's orbital plane. Earth's axis is inclined by an angle of 23.4° against that orbital axis. This tilt is the cause of Earth's seasons. In particular, over the course of one orbit, there are phases where the northern hemisphere or the southern one are tilted toward the Sun, thus receiving more light.\n\nRelative to the most distant celestial objects, the direction Earth's axis points towards changes slowly over time, in what is called Earth's axial precession. Currently, the Earth's axis intersects the celestial sphere close to Polaris, the North Star. But over roughly 26,000 years, that intersection point describes a small circle in the sky.

The simplest case is that of a body that is spherically symmetric – which is an excellent approximation for describing stars and planets. In this case, the escape velocity at a distance r from the center of a body of mass m, is given by √(2Gm/r), where G is the gravitational constant. At the surface of a spherical body the distance from its center is its radius. This means that the escape velocity at the surface of an approximately spherical celestial body depends on the radius and its mass. In the case of the Sun, it is 617.5 kilometers per second (km/s), and for Earth, 11.2 km/s. It is 2.4 km/s for the Moon, which means that an object on the Moon needs to attain a lower speed to escape the Moon's gravity than an object on Earth would need to leave Earth's gravity.",

    "Definition": "Extraterrestrial intelligence refers to the possible existence of intelligent entities other than those on Earth.\n\nSearches for extraterrestrial intelligence have included looking for radio or other signals, but much current research is centered on determining whether the conditions for intelligent life are present elsewhere. Going by the available evidence, the necessary conditions for the emergence of life on Earth – a solid planet, at a distance from its star where liquid water can exist on the planet's surface, atoms like carbon and oxygen, and the conditions to form more complex molecules – should exist on numerous other planets within our Galaxy and beyond. It is not an unreasonable assumption that intelligent life might have arisen at least on some of those planets, although we have no solid basis for estimating the probability of that happening.\n\nSome astronomers have used radio signals to search for putative messages as part of a Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). The speed of light as a fundamental physical limit means that interstellar journeys would take very long times, limiting the ability for us to come into direct contact with extraterrestrial intelligences.",

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, on the other hand, has long been searching for possible radio signals from intelligent life on other worlds.

Europa's entire surface is covered with ice. Under the ice is believed to be an ocean of liquid water which is one of the best candidates for harboring life outside of Earth in the Solar System. Ganymede is the largest moon in our Solar System, and also the moon with the largest mass, at twice the mass of Earth's Moon. Callisto is almost exactly the same size as the planet Mercury, but has only about one third of Mercury's mass.\n\nThe four Galilean moons were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610, as one of several discoveries in Galilei's pioneering campaign of using a telescope for astronomical observations. Galilei was able to document that, over time, the four moons orbit Jupiter like a miniature solar system. This was a clear demonstration that astronomical objects can orbit a center other than the Earth; this observation played an important role in the shifting of the scientific consensus from the Earth-centered (geocentric) to the Sun-centered (heliocentric) view of the Solar System.",

    "Term": "Galilean Telescope",
    "Definition": "In a refracting telescope, light first encounters a convex lens (converging lens), called the objective lens, which serves to bundle infalling parallel light rays. Such almost perfectly parallel light rays correspond to light we receive from a distant object, such as a star. In order to produce an image that can be observed by eye, those converging rays must be made parallel again. This is the task of an additional optical element: the eyepiece, which is where you put your eye if you observe through a telescope.\n\nIn a Galilean telescope, named after the model of telescope built by Galileo Galilei in 1609 and used for some of the first systematic astronomical telescope observations, this is achieved by inserting a concave lens (diverging lens) as the eyepiece.\n\nIn contrast, in a Keplerian telescope, invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, the converging light rays are allowed to cross, and the resulting divergent light rays are then made parallel using a second convex lens. Compared to a Keplerian telescope, a Galilean telescope provides a visual image that is upright (not inverted), but it has a much narrower field of view than a Keplerian telescope.\n\nThe wider field of view is why nearly all modern refracting telescopes used by amateur astronomers are Keplerian in design – in the case of particularly high-quality telescopes, Keplerian with additional lenses providing improved image quality. For professional astronomy, the distinction between Keplerian and Galilean is largely irrelevant: professional observations use cameras instead of eye pieces, and most professional telescopes are reflective (mirror) telescopes, not refracting telescopes.",

In both cases the names can be confusing as most of the material in gas giants is not in a gaseous state and ice giants do not contain solid ice, rather material that was frozen in the cold outer Solar System before it was accreted onto the planet.\n\nThe four largest planets in the Solar System (Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus) are all giant planets.",

    "Definition": "Global warming is a warming of a planet's atmosphere by greenhouse gases, such as water molecules, carbon dioxide, methane, etc. This is caused by an increase in the greenhouse effect where more infrared radiation is trapped by the atmosphere, thus increasing the global mean temperature of a planet. The sources of greenhouse gases can be natural or (on Earth) additionally caused by human industrial activity.

This effect, predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, was first observed during the solar eclipse of 1919 when the bending of starlight from several stars near the Sun was measured. Gravitational lensing is most apparent for very massive objects such as galaxies or galaxy clusters. If observers on Earth are looking at a distant object whose light is thus bent (by \"the lens\"), the object will appear distorted. This distortion always implies light (de)magnification, typically allowing us to better see otherwise faint background objects. When the lens has enough mass concentrated in a small angular area, multiple images of the same background object are produced, each having its light reaching the observer at different times. Measuring these so-called \"time delays\" is one of the best ways to determine the value of the Hubble Constant on extragalactic scales. Multiple images from a lens, on the other hand, allow us to precisely determine its mass (using modelling); this is a very useful method for finding the mass of galaxies and, especially, galaxy clusters.",

The orbital period has decreased as it loses energy by radiating away gravitational waves.\n\nThe first detection of gravitational waves was made in September 2015 by the two gravitational wave detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).

Visible light from the Sun reaches the surface of a planet and is re-emitted as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases trap this infrared radiation within the atmosphere and hence the radiation cannot escape to free space; this makes the planet warmer than it would have been without these gases. Without the greenhouse effect, Earth's temperature would be tens of degrees below 0 degrees Celsius. However, the equilibrium temperature that results from the greenhouse effect is very sensitive to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nHuman-made emissions of greenhouse gases since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century have led to global warming on Earth due to the greenhouse effect.\n\nIn certain circumstances, this heating can lead to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, causing a runaway greenhouse effect.

Where the effective temperature is used, it is shown on a logarithmic scale, increasing from right to left. The HR diagram is named after two scientists: Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell who first made different versions of this graph in order to understand the properties of stars. The data points corresponding to the so-called \"main sequence stars\" lie on a diagonal band from the upper left to lower right in this graph. Data points corresponding to giant stars lie above and to the right of the main-sequence band. White dwarfs lie below and to the left of the band.\n\nThe HR diagram can also be a useful framework for representing the evolution of a star over time. Once a star has formed it will be positioned on the main sequence of the HR diagram, and its temperature and luminosity will remain roughly constant for some time. Later, as it evolves, the star's temperature will drop and its luminosity will increase. This means the star's position on the HR diagram moves up and to the right, away from the main sequence towards the giant branch. A star's evolution, specifically its changes in temperature and luminosity, can be represented by a curve in the HR diagram. Thus a star's evolutionary state can be determined from its temperature and luminosity using the HR diagram.",

The points in the sky directly above Earth's equator form the celestial equator on that sphere. The point directly above Earth's geographic North Pole is the celestial North Pole, and that above Earth's South Pole, the celestial South Pole.\n\nJust like geographers define geographic longitude and latitude on Earth's surface, one can define longitude and latitude on the celestial sphere. The meridian of an observer corresponds to the observer's geographical meridian (the circle whose center is the Earth's center, and which intersects the North Pole, South Pole, and the observer's position), projected onto the celestial sphere. It intersects the north point on the observer's horizon, the zenith, and the south point. The projected meridian that passes through a given celestial object is called that object's hour circle. The hour angle is the angle between the object's hour circle and the observer's meridian. As time passes, the hour angle changes: An hour angle of zero corresponds to the star's highest position (its upper culmination) in the sky. As the star moves towards the western horizon, the hour angle increases. As the hour angle approaches 360 degrees, the star approaches its next upper culmination. Note the time between upper culminations is one sidereal day, this is roughly four minutes shorter than a solar day. Because of this direct connection with time, the hour angle is usually stated in hours, not in degrees, with 360 degrees corresponding to 24 hours. The hour angle can be used to compute the time until an object's upper culmination. This is useful to astronomers planning their observations: at or near upper culmination, when it is farthest from the horizon, is a particularly good time to observe an object.",

In astronomy, hydrogen fusion is the nuclear fusion reaction that transforms hydrogen nuclei (each consisting of a single proton) into helium-4 nuclei (each consisting of two protons and two neutrons bound together). The helium-4 nucleus has a mass less than the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons it is made of. By Einstein's famous formula E=mc2, that mass difference corresponds to an energy difference. As the protons and neutrons fuse to form helium-4, the amount of energy corresponding to that difference is released. In this way, hydrogen fusion serves as the energy source for so-called main sequence stars like our Sun. At least for some time, such stars are in an equilibrium state: the amount of energy released by hydrogen fusion in their cores corresponds to the energy those brightly-shining stars emit in the form of light and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation as well as particles.\n\nHydrogen fusion proceeds via several intermediate steps. For stars with the mass of our Sun or less, it proceeds via the so-called proton–proton chain (pp chain). In the simplest version of that chain of reactions, two hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse to yield deuterium nuclei (one proton, one neutron each), which then fuse with one additional hydrogen nucleus to yield helium-3 (two protons, one neutron). Two such helium-3 nuclei fuse to yield helium-4 plus two remaining hydrogen nuclei. In stars with more than about 1.3 times the mass of our Sun, an alternative process called the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen (CNO) cycle becomes the dominant way for fusing hydrogen into helium. Scientists on Earth have built machines to create fusion reactions with the hope that in future it can become a viable way of generating energy. Hydrogen fusion occurs not only in stars, but also took place during the early Big Bang phase of our Universe.",

    "Definition": "In science, hypothesis refers to an idea, or prediction a scientist may have. It may have some evidence, but it has not been proven. It is only through experimentation, observations, data, and models, that a hypothesis is gradually refined or completely discounted. Contrary to popular belief a hypothesis is not always the first stage in the development of scientific knowledge. For example, scientists make observations of phenomena or objects, analyze the data, and then propose an explanation or make a prediction of what could be going on: That is their hypothesis. It is only through additional data and observations that the hypothesis is validated, or not. A hypothesis can have a mathematical basis or start with a mathematical formulation that makes a prediction.",

Infrared observations are less affected by extinction and can thus see deeper into interstellar clouds of gas and dust.\n\nMolecules in Earth's atmosphere absorb much of the infrared light coming from space and thus infrared astronomy on the ground is done mostly in wavelength ranges where this absorption is lower. Both Earth and its atmosphere radiate in the infrared so special techniques are required to remove this background radiation. For infrared radiation with longer wavelengths, this background plus atmospheric absorption makes observing on the ground almost impossible. As a result many infrared observations are carried out using space telescopes. However, for the longest infrared wavelengths ground-based observations are possible from very dry sites. This is typically called submillimeter astronomy.",

Interstellar dust has a much larger effect on starlight as compared to the gas particles. Huge lanes of dust and gas in the Milky Way can be observed with the naked eye as gaps between the faint glow of millions of stars. Extinction makes observations of regions with lots of gas and dust difficult. Extinction is generally higher at shorter wavelengths making astronomical objects appear redder (reddening).

This density varies greatly, along with the temperature, across the Galaxy with the ISM split into several different components.\n\nThe largest components by volume in the galactic disk are the warm atomic gas and warm ionized gas, both with temperatures around 8000 kelvins (K) and densities around half an atom or ion per cubic centimeter. A smaller volume is in the form of colder, denser atomic gas with a temperature around 40 K. A still smaller volume of the ISM is in the form of denser (up to a million molecules per cubic centimeter), colder (<20 K) clouds of molecular hydrogen. Some of these molecular clouds will collapse under their own gravity, leading to the formation of new stars. Molecular clouds in the Milky Way are mostly found in its spiral arms. The gas surrounding the Milky Way's disk is very hot (millions of kelvins) and very low density.\n\nStars put gas and dust back into the ISM through stellar winds and supernovae. The gas and dust returned to the ISM have a higher fraction of heavy elements (metals), thus enriching the galaxy over time. The gas and dust in the interstellar medium is the main cause of interstellar extinction.",

    "Definition": "A lens is an optical device that, due to refraction, bends light so that it either focuses or disperses. Lenses are typically made from glass, plastic, or some other transparent material. Convex lenses focus light, drawing a parallel beam of light together to a point. Concave lenses spread a parallel beam of light so that it appears to originate from a point.\n\nLenses are the main components in refracting telescopes as well as binoculars. Even if an astronomical telescope is a reflecting telescope (one that uses mirrors to focus light), it is likely that the cameras and spectrographs attached to the telescope will use one or more lenses.\n\nA massive object can be referred to as a \"gravitational lens\" when it induces optical distortion in the image of another background object. This distortion is due to bending of light from the background object due to the gravity of the massive foreground object; this phenomenon is referred to as gravitational lensing.",

This is a narrow part of the electromagnetic spectrum that covers a wide range of wavelengths from gamma (the shortest) to radio waves (the longest). More broadly the term light is sometimes applied to any electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe basic properties of light are intensity, direction of propagation, frequency, spectrum, and polarization. Its speed in a vacuum is defined to be exactly 299,792,458 meters per second, and this is one of the fundamental constants of nature. The color of light depends on its wavelength. Violet light has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum; red has the longest. Light has multiple sources, natural and artificial; the Sun is the Earth's main source of light.

When a celestial object in the sky crosses the meridian it is at either its highest or lowest point in the sky.\n\nFrom the observer's perspective the celestial sphere appears to rotate around the Earth. This means that celestial objects on the sky follow a circular path during the course of a day. Most objects rise in the east, move higher in the sky until they cross the meridian, and then move lower in the sky to set in the west. Circumpolar objects are objects that are close enough to one of the celestial poles that an observer could see their full circular path over one sidereal day (a little less than 24 hours). In all cases the highest point in the sky a celestial object reaches is when it crosses the meridian. The instant when it reaches this highest point is referred to as its upper culmination. Twelve (sidereal) hours later, when the object is at its lowest point in the sky (often this is below the horizon), this instant is referred to as its lower culmination.\n\nAs culmination is the moment when a celestial object crosses the observer's local meridian it is often referred to as a meridian transit or meridian passage. The hour angle on the sky is defined relative to the observer's local meridian, hence by definition upper culmination happens at an hour angle of zero and lower culmination happens at an hour angle of 12 hours.",

The magnitude system used in astronomy originated in antiquity as a ranking of stars from the brightest to the least bright. That is why a smaller (or more negative) magnitude value means that the object is brighter, and a larger number means a fainter object. Hence a star with magnitude -1 is brighter than a star with magnitude 0 which in turn is brighter than a star of magnitude 1.\n\nMagnitude has a logarithmic scale, in which a magnitude difference of five corresponds to a factor of 100 difference in the amount of energy received: a star with magnitude 10 is a hundred times dimmer than a star with magnitude 5.\n\nThere are different types of magnitude: apparent magnitude measures the apparent brightness of an object, which depends both on the object's luminosity – how much light the object emits – and on its distance from Earth.\n\nIn contrast, the absolute magnitude is the value we would obtain if the object were at a standard distance of 10 parsecs (32.6 light years) from Earth. (For reflecting objects such as asteroids, there is a different definition.)\n\nIn practice, magnitude is specified for observations through a specific filter, corresponding to an object's brightness in a given wavelength range of light. Numerous \"photometric systems\" for specifying filters, and corresponding magnitudes, exist. In contrast, the bolometric magnitude is a direct measure of the luminosity of an object: the total electromagnetic energy emitted in unit time.

It is a rocky, terrestrial planet with a radius of a little under 3400 kilometers (km), just over one half of the Earth's radius. Mars has a very thin atmosphere, a large canyon system, and the tallest mountain in the Solar System: an extinct volcano called Olympus Mons. It is thought to have hosted liquid water earlier in its existence.\n\nIts typical distance from the Sun is about 228 million km or 1.52 astronomical units (Earth–Sun distances). It takes 687 days to complete one orbit of the Sun. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\nIt is named after the Roman god of war. It is often called the \"red planet\" due to its reddish rusty color. Scientists have sent many landers to Mars over the years to study its composition and atmosphere.",

    "Term": "Mass",
    "Definition": "Mass is the amount of matter a body contains. The number, type, and density of atoms that make up the body combine to determine the mass of that body. In everyday speech mass and weight are often used interchangeably but in physics they are not the same. Mass remains the same regardless of location while weight depends on the local gravitational field.\n\nThere are two concepts of mass: \"gravitational mass\" and \"inertial mass\". \"Inertial mass\" is the property of matter that causes it to resist acceleration; it is the mass in Newton's second law. We see that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. Hence the more massive a body the less it accelerates for a given force.\n\n\"Gravitational mass\" is the property of matter that causes it to exert and experience the gravitational force. The more massive a body, the greater force due to gravity it feels.\n\nAlbert Einstein asserted that these two mass concepts are identical via his \"principle of equivalence\". This is a fundamental concept in physics.\n\nThe kilogram (kg) is the internationally recognized unit of mass measurement (other units can be used such as: grams, milligrams, ton, ounce, and pound), and mass is represented by the symbol m. Mass is a scalar quantity and is a form of energy. As such, it can be transformed into other forms of energy, such as during nuclear reactions, and it is not strictly conserved. Massless particles, such as photons, the particles that carry electromagnetic radiation, exist in nature.",

It is a rocky, terrestrial planet with a radius of about 2500 kilometers (km), which is slightly larger than the Earth's Moon. It has a mass of 0.055 times the mass of the Earth. Due to its close distance, the Sun is seven times brighter seen from Mercury, and Mercury's surface is much affected by the solar wind. Its very thin exosphere is made of material produced by this interaction, plus matter blasted off the surface due to frequent falling objects. The thin atmosphere cannot keep the planet's temperature, so the surface is extremely cold (-180 degrees Celsius) during the night, and extremely hot (400 degrees Celsius) during the day, and thus very dry.\n\nIts typical distance from the Sun is about 58 million km, about 0.39 astronomical units (Earth–Sun distances), taking a little under 88 days to complete one orbit. Mercury has no moons known to orbit it.\n\nAs Mercury orbits the Sun closer than the Earth, it always appears close to the Sun in the sky. Mercury is named after the speedy Roman messenger god, derived from its fast motion across the sky. Two space probes (Mariner 10 and MESSENGER) have visited Mercury, with the BepiColombo mission due to arrive in the mid-2020s.",

However, stony meteorites often look like terrestrial rocks so can be overlooked and iron meteorites are the most common type of meteorite found on the ground. Most meteorites are found in Antarctica or deserts as this is where they are easiest to spot.\n\nMost of the found meteorites range from a few grams to several kilograms in mass.

Any asteroid or comet that, on its orbit, comes closer to the Sun than 1.3 times the Earth–Sun distance (in astronomical terms: 1.3 astronomical units) is called a Near-Earth Object (NEO). Most NEOs are Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs).\n\nA NEO is called a Potentially Hazardous Object (PHO) if it has the following properties: For one, it needs to come closer to Earth's orbit than 5% of the Earth–Sun distance (closer than 0.05 astronomical units). In addition such an object needs to have a certain minimum size – otherwise, it would pose no danger to Earth. Size is difficult to measure for smaller objects in the Solar System, so astronomers instead use a minimal value for such an object's absolute brightness – after all, the larger an object is, the brighter it is likely to be. To qualify as a PHO, an object needs to have an absolute magnitude of 22.0 or brighter (using the magnitude system as astronomy's standard way of measuring brightness). Most PHOs are Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs).",

    "Term": "Nebula",
    "Definition": "A nebula is a distant celestial object that has the appearance of a cloud. Usually, a nebula consists of interstellar gas and dust. Historically, the term nebulae included any extended fuzzy-looking object, including what we today recognize as galaxies – distant star systems like our own Milky Way galaxy. Today, the term nebula is restricted to gas and dust clouds that are part of the interstellar medium – the gas and dust between stars within a galaxy. The category includes a number of different kinds of object: Molecular clouds are comparatively cold and dark, and predominantly consist of molecular hydrogen; inside clouds like this is where new stars are formed. Giant molecular clouds can contain up to a few millions of solar masses' worth of hydrogen gas. Young stars frequently emit narrow jets of ionized gas; when those jets excite the surrounding gas, the result is a type of nebula called a Herbig–Haro object. When massive stars have formed, their intense radiation makes the surrounding gas emit characteristic reddish light; the results are nebulae of hot and ionized hydrogen gas which are called HII regions. Other types of nebula are associated with the death of stars: low-mass stars leave behind expanding shells of gas that are (somewhat confusingly) called planetary nebulae. When a high-mass star explodes as a supernova, the ejected gas forms a type of nebula called a supernova remnant.",

    "Definition": "Neptune is the eighth, and farthest, major planet from the Sun. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune is an ice giant. Neptune's radius is just under 25 thousand kilometers (km), a little less than four times Earth's radius. Neptune has a solid rock core surrounded by a layer of high-pressure water, methane, and ammonia. In the early outer Solar System these chemicals were frozen and accreted onto the young Neptune, hence the name \"ice giant\". Neptune's outer atmosphere is a thick, puffy layer of hydrogen and helium.\n\nIts typical distance from the Sun is about 4.5 billion km, around 30 astronomical units (Earth–Sun distances). Neptune has at least 14 moons and a faint ring system. As the outermost major planet, Neptune's gravity plays a pivotal role in shaping the orbits of smaller bodies in the Kuiper Belt.\n\nNeptune is not visible to the naked eye. It was first identified due to the effect its gravity has on the orbit of Uranus. The mathematicians John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier both predicted Neptune's existence and location in the early 1840s. Based on Le Verrier's calculations, Johann Gottfried Galle first identified Neptune in 1846. Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea.",

Nuclear reactions and high energy densities in supernova explosions also produce bursts of neutrinos. Observing neutrinos is difficult as they interact very weakly with atoms. Typically neutrinos are detected by observing huge tanks of water (or blocks of ice such as at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole). When a neutrino hits a water molecule in one of these tanks (or in the block of ice), it sets off particle reactions that lead to tiny amounts of light being produced. This light can be detected and analyzed. Neutrinos have been detected from the nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun and from supernovae. Neutrinos are also produced by nuclear reactors and by you. In the latter instance, neutrinos are emitted in the decay of the radioactive atomic nuclei carbon-14 and potassium-40 in the human body.",

These areas have no night around the time of the summer solstice.\n\nThe period when the Sun is just below the horizon is called twilight. During twilight, the Sun still illuminates part of the sky. Twilight is divided into three equal periods: Civil twilight, nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight. During civil twilight – when the Sun is zero to six degrees below the horizon – the sky is relatively bright so artificial illumination such as street lighting is often not required. Nautical twilight – when the Sun is six to 12 degrees below the horizon – has both bright stars visible and a sky bright enough to see the horizon even on a moonless night. This allows sailors to navigate using celestial navigation. Astronomical twilight is when the Sun is 12 to 18 degrees below the horizon.",

    "Term": "Nuclear Fusion",
    "Definition": "Nuclear fusion is the process where the atomic nuclei of lighter elements join together to form the nucleus of a heavier element.\n\nIn the Universe, nuclear fusion plays two important roles. For one, it provides the energy supply for the radiation emitted by stars like our Sun. When sufficiently light nuclei fuse, the total rest mass of the resulting nucleus is slightly smaller than the combined rest masses of the initial nuclei. This \"mass deficit\" corresponds to the energy released by the fusion reaction, via Einstein's famous formula E=mc2, which links mass m, energy E, and the speed of light c. For example, in the core of the Sun, hydrogen nuclei fuse together to form helium and release energy in the form of radiation as well as neutrino particles.\n\nThe second role of nuclear fusion is that it is responsible for producing elements in the Universe that are more complex than hydrogen and helium. After the Big Bang, only hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of lithium nuclei existed in the Universe. Fusion reactions in the cores of stars, in the course of supernova explosions, and from explosions caused by colliding neutron stars, are the source of (essentially) all the remaining heavier chemical elements in the Universe. The chemical elements that make up the greatest part of the human body by mass, notably oxygen and carbon, were formed by nuclear fusion in the core of stars or during supernova explosions, prompting the expression \"we are star dust\".",

Atomic nuclei consist of protons, which are positively charged, and neutrons, which carry no electric charge. Although the protons repel each other due to their electric charge, there is an even stronger force, called the strong nuclear force or just the strong force, that holds the nucleus together. Nuclei with the same number of protons form atoms that belong to the same chemical element.\n\nNuclei are tiny, only about 1/100,000th of the size of an atom – so in a sense, most of the atom is empty space! The nucleus typically accounts for more than 99.9% of an atom's total mass. That mass at such tiny size makes nuclei very dense, with typical densities of a hundred million billion kilograms per cubic meter.\n\nNuclei are important in different areas of astrophysics. In the interior of stars, energy is set free as lighter nuclei (starting with hydrogen, whose nucleus is a single proton) fuse to form successively heavier nuclei – this is what makes stars shine. Nuclear fusion in stars can form heavy nuclei up to those of iron, with supernova explosions and the interior of certain cool stars able to form even heavier nuclei. Shortly after the Big Bang, a brief phase of \"Big Bang nucleosynthesis\" had hydrogen nuclei fusing to helium and traces of other elements. Neutron stars, as the remnants of the supernova explosions of massive stars, consist of mostly neutrons stacked to similar densities as those of nuclei.

In addition, the Earth's atmosphere is transparent not only for visible light, but for the directly adjacent infrared and ultraviolet regions, allowing all three kinds of observations from the ground. Last but not least, the camera chips astronomers use for visible-light observations can also detect near-infrared and ultraviolet light. Put all of this together, and the telescopes and instruments astronomers use to observe visible light work just as well for near-infrared and ultraviolet observations. In consequence, it makes sense for astronomers to collectively describe observations in that range of the electromagnetic spectrum with a single term, namely optical astronomy. The adjective \"optical\" is also used to describe the spectral range, as in \"the optical part of the spectrum.\" Observations in that range are \"optical observations\".",

    "Term": "Parallax",
    "Definition": "Parallax is the apparent change in position of a celestial object on the sky due to a change in the observer’s point of view. The position change in the sky, expressed as an angle, is determined relative to the most distant objects we know – historically, distant stars; in modern astronomy, extremely distant objects called quasars, which determine what is called the International Celestial Reference Frame. The angle of apparent position change is inversely proportional to the object's distance from us, making parallax measurements a powerful tool for determining distances in our cosmic neighborhood (\"parallax method\"). For Solar System objects, simultaneous observations from different locations on Earth can yield useful parallax values. For stars, parallax angles are given for a standard shift of observer position by one astronomical unit (the average Earth–Sun distance) at right angles to the line of sight. Observer position shifts of that magnitude can be achieved by making observations several months apart, with Earth moving along its orbit around the Sun in between. By definition, an object whose parallax angle under those conditions is 1 arcsecond is at a distance of 1 parsec (3.26 light years) from Earth. Over one year, the apparent position of a star in the sky traces out an ellipse, whose semi-major axis is the parallax angle. The most accurate stellar parallaxes to date are supplied by ESA's Gaia mission, a space telescope specifically designed for that task.",

    "Term": "Parsec",
    "Definition": "The parsec (pc) is a standard unit of distance measure in astronomy, defined as follows: Imagine a circle with a radius of one astronomical unit (which is the average Earth–Sun distance), which we are viewing face-on. From a distance of exactly one parsec, we will see the circle's radius subtend an angle of one arcsecond. This makes 1 pc equal to approximately 3.26 light years, and to as many astronomical units as there are arcseconds in one radian: 206,264.8 astronomical units. The practical importance of this definition is its relation to the parallax method of distance determination. For this method, one measures tiny position shifts of astronomical objects in the sky as the observer position changes by a given length. For an astronomical object at a distance of one parsec, a change in observer position by one astronomical unit (usually because the Earth has moved along its orbit between the two observations) corresponds to an apparent position shift, called the object's parallax (angle), of one arcsecond. This results in a simple relationship: The distance in parsecs is one divided by the parallax angle in arcseconds. Its direct geometrical meaning makes the parsec the professional astronomer's preferred measure of distance, more common in the literature than distances given in light years. Sirius is 2.7 pc distant from us, corresponding to a parallax of 1/2.7=0.37 arcseconds. Even Proxima Centauri, the closest star apart from our Sun, has a parallax of less than 1 arcsecond.",

Similarly, only about half of a spherical body's surface is within a distant observer's sight. The phase specifies which fraction of the surface within the observer's sight is illuminated. It changes as the relative positions of the object, the observer, and the light source change.\n\nThe best-known examples are the phases of the Moon. The relative positions of the Moon, of the Earth as the location of the observer, and of the Sun as the light source, change as the Moon orbits the Earth over the course of about one month. Hence, over that time, an observer on Earth will see different phases of the Moon. The phase where all of the Moon's surface that is in the observer's sight is illuminated is called \"full Moon\"; when no illuminated surface regions are visible, we have \"new Moon\". The two half-illuminated phases are called \"first\" or \"second quarter\", respectively. Less-than-half illumination makes for a \"crescent (Moon)\".\n\nPhases are also seen in planets in the Solar System (particularly prominent for Mercury and Venus), and have been inferred for exoplanet systems. For the Moon, even non-illuminated regions are not completely dark: they reflect light reaching them from Earth, in a phenomenon known as Earthshine, first documented by Leonardo da Vinci.",

    "Definition": "A planet is defined by the International Astronomical Union as a celestial body in orbit around a star or the remnant of a star, that is large enough to be nearly round in shape by its own gravitational force, but not massive enough for thermonuclear fusion to ever occur in its core. It must also be large enough for its gravity to remove other objects that pass close to its orbit around the star. Therefore, they are cold bodies (as compared to stars) that shine in the visible band only by the light reflected from their stars but they do emit light at infrared wavelengths. In our Solar System, eight planets orbit around the Sun. Planets may be basically rocky objects, such as the inner planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars – or primarily liquid and gas with a small solid core like the outer planets – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Planets outside the Solar System are called extrasolar planets or exoplanets for short.",

This is a protoplanetary disk, where planets form: Ice-covered dust particles will stick to each other, forming slightly larger clumps, which will continue to grow. There are still open questions about how the next stages happen: What, for instance, is the role of turbulent gas motion in bringing those clumps closer together? Eventually, so-called planetesimals more than about a kilometer in size are formed. Some of those are pulled together by their own gravity to form larger planets, others remain behind as the first asteroids. Some protoplanets manage to draw large amounts of gas towards them to become gas giants. Some other protoplanets in cold regions far from the central star will accrete large amounts of frozen material along with gas, becoming ice giants. Others, with less gas, become terrestrial planets.",

Its elevation above the horizon gives the approximate latitude of the observing site. However, its position on the celestial sphere is slowly changing due to the precession of the rotation axis of Earth, so in several centuries Polaris will not indicate the location of the celestial North Pole anymore.\n\nPolaris is a triple star system, composed of the primary, a yellow supergiant designated Polaris Aa, in orbit with a smaller companion, Polaris Ab, a very close main sequence star; the pair has a wide companion, Polaris B, a main sequence star orbiting at a distance of 2400 astronomical units (the orbital period is about 29.3 years). Polaris B can be resolved with a modest telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope was able to resolve all three members of the Polaris ternary system.

    "Term": "Precession",
    "Definition": "In astronomy precession is the gradual change of the rotational axis or orbital parameters of an object.\n\nThe most significant precession in astronomy is the precession of the Earth's axis. The Earth's slightly non-spherical shape, combined with the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon leads the Earth's rotation axis to trace out a cone over roughly 26,000 years. This leads to gradual changes in the positions of the celestial poles and the celestial coordinate system. The position of the Sun at the equinoxes also changes, with the Sun's positions at the spring and autumn equinox moving through the constellations of the Zodiac over a 26,000-year cycle.\n\nThe orientations of orbits can also precess. Orbits of planets and other objects around the Sun are elliptical. The orientations of these ellipses can change gradually over time. The best-known example is the precession of Mercury's orbit. The closest point of Mercury's orbit around the Sun changes gradually, moving around the Sun very slowly, over a period of over two million years. The rate Mercury's orbit changes in this way is not well-modelled by classical mechanics. The correct modelling of this effect was one of the key tests passed by Einstein's theory of general relativity. Another notable precession is the precession of the Moon's orbit around the Earth.",

    "Definition": "When astronomers observe a distant object, the radial velocity is the part of the object's motion along the observer's line of sight – taking the object directly away from or directly towards the observer. Radial velocities are measured using the Doppler effect: For astronomical objects moving towards us, spectral lines are shifted towards smaller wavelengths (blueshift); for objects moving away from us, the lines are shifted towards larger wavelengths (redshift). Radial velocity is always relative to an observer. Precision measurements often give their results in terms of radial motion relative to the center of mass of the Solar System (\"barycentric\"), subtracting the influence of Earth's motion around the Sun. Objects that are orbiting each other have radial velocities that vary over time. The effect is strongest when we happen to see the orbital plane edge-on. In that case, orbital motion will periodically, and by turns, take each of the objects directly away from us and directly towards us. Radial velocity measurements can be used to deduce such orbital motions even when the objects themselves are not separately visible. Since higher masses induce higher velocities, such measurements can be used to estimate the orbiting objects' masses. This has been used to discover binary stars, or exoplanets orbiting stars, and for reconstructing the masses of star clusters and whole galaxies. A systematic analysis of galaxies' distances and radial velocities led to the discovery of cosmic expansion.",

The radiative zone, radiative region, or radiation zone is the region within a star where the energy is transported outwards by means of radiation, with photons repeatedly scattering off nuclei and electrons, losing some energy in the process but also leading to the emission of new thermal-radiation photons. Due to frequent scattering, progress is slow; in our Sun, photons need thousands of years to cross the radiative zone.\n\nIn the Sun the radiative zone lies between the core and the convective zone. In more massive stars the core itself is convective with the radiative zone extending from the convective core to the star's photosphere.

    "Term": "Radio Astronomy",
    "Definition": "Radio astronomy is the branch of astronomy concerned with observations of radio waves, a special region in the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere has \"radio windows\": It allows radio waves in certain frequency (or wavelength) ranges to pass nearly unhindered. That fact allows for observations of such radio waves from astronomical objects with ground-based radio telescopes. Typical observing frequencies range from an upper limit of about 300 gigahertz (GHz) down to tens of megahertz (MHz). This corresponds to wavelengths of 1 millimeter (mm) to tens of meters, respectively. By going to particularly suitable dry, high-altitude locations, astronomers can even perform submillimeter observations, down to wavelengths of about 0.3 mm, corresponding to frequencies of up to 1 terahertz (THz). The lower frequency limit at about 10 MHz is due to Earth's so-called ionosphere. That high-altitude region within our atmosphere contains numerous charged particles, which reflect ultra-long radio waves right back into space. Radio astronomy enables us to observe the emission from cold gas in galaxies and the Milky Way, such as atomic hydrogen and molecular gas. In this way, astronomers can study the diffuse interstellar medium, as well as the regions and processes in which stars and planets are born. Radio astronomy also allows for the study of highly energetic objects such as pulsars and active galactic nuclei: In or around objects like those, electrons are accelerated in a strong magnetic field, leading to the emission of radio waves known as synchrotron radiation. Pulsars and the very bright active galactic nuclei known as quasars were discovered using radio astronomy, as was the remnant of our Universe's hot Big Bang phase, the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although radio waves from space were first detected in the 1930s, radio astronomy only became a major branch of observational astronomy after 1950.",

    "Term": "Radio Telescope",
    "Definition": "Radio telescopes receive radio waves from space. Depending on the observing wavelength they may have a parabola shape, similar to a satellite dish with a receiver at the focal point, or may have metal rod-like figures sometimes referred to as dipole antennas. The signals are then amplified and processed by computer. A radio telescope can be a single dish or a number of antennas linked together to form an interferometer where a special computer called a correlator combines signals from the different radio telescopes to yield information that can then be processed into an image. They mostly observe radio waves, with frequencies ranging from about 30 megahertz to 300 gigahertz, or 10 meters to 1 millimeter in wavelength. Individual telescopes and receivers are optimized for specific regions within this band. Some radio dishes are optimized to observe light with slightly shorter wavelength in a region of the electromagnetic spectrum known as the submillimeter.",

    "Definition": "The huge arc or bow with concentric stripes in the colors violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, spread out across the sky, usually visible after it has rained, is called a rainbow. When an observer sees a rainbow, the Sun is at the observer's back. A rainbow occurs because the small droplets of water in the air break up the white sunlight into the color spectrum through a process called dispersion due to refraction; this is similar to how a prism works. In a normal rainbow, light is reflected once within the water droplets as well as being dispersed through refraction.\n\nSometimes, two nested rainbows can be seen, where the colors in the second rainbow are in reverse order. The inner, brighter one is called the primary rainbow while the outer, fainter one is the secondary rainbow. This double rainbow phenomenon is relatively uncommon. The secondary rainbow occurs when light undergoes reflection twice within the water droplets in addition to refraction.",

Stars with masses between about 8% and 50% of the mass of the Sun spend the vast majority of their lives as red dwarfs. These stars fuse hydrogen at a much slower rate than stars like the Sun and are thus fainter, but can sustain hydrogen fusion for much longer.

Red giants were originally main sequence stars, that is, Sun-like stars that burn hydrogen to helium in their cores via nuclear fusion. When such a star runs out of hydrogen fuel, it begins to burn helium into heavier elements. At that time, the star expands, its surface cooling down in the process, and with its increased size the star becomes more luminous. The Sun will enter the red giant phase billions of years from now, at which time life on Earth will likely not survive. Examples of red giants are Arcturus in the constellation Boötes and Mira in the constellation Cetus. Red giants are unstable to pulsation (an oscillation where the star repeatedly becomes smaller and larger in turn) and, as they pulsate, can vary in brightness. The star Mira is an extreme example that can vary in brightness by a factor of 1000. In the spectral classification used by astronomers, red giants are mostly of spectral type M, and some are of spectral type K. Red giants are similar to so-called red supergiants, but with a lower mass.",

Both types were originally main sequence stars, that is, stars like our Sun that burn hydrogen to helium in their cores via nuclear fusion (although with masses much higher than the Sun's in the case of red supergiants). When such a star runs out of hydrogen fuel, it begins to burn helium into heavier elements. At that time, the star expands, its surface cooling down in the process, and with its increased size the star becomes more luminous. The remaining lifetimes of red supergiants amount to only a few tens of thousands of years.\n\nExamples of red supergiants are Betelgeuse, in Orion, and Antares, in Scorpius. Like red giants, red supergiants are prone to pulsation and mass loss. Most, possibly all, red supergiants end in a supernova explosion, ejecting much of their gas, with their cores collapsing to form neutron stars or black holes.",

This is similar to the Doppler effect in the context of sound waves. Cosmological redshift is the result of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a source being stretched to longer wavelengths because of the physical expansion of space, unlike Doppler redshift which is due to relative motion. Gravitational redshift refers to the effect where the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation emitted from a source is stretched to longer wavelengths, or rather the associated photons lose energy as they try to leave a region (gravitational well) where the gravity is stronger.",

Still larger collecting areas can be obtained by combining several mirror segments, which then act in a way similar to that of a larger solid mirror. There are several types of mirror telescopes. For example, in a Newtonian telescope, the light coming from the primary mirror is reflected sideways by a smaller, flat mirror into an eyepiece or a camera. In a Cassegrain telescope, a smaller, convex secondary mirror reflects the light back through an opening in the main mirror.",

In professional astronomy, refracting telescopes were largely displaced by mirror telescopes from the early 1900s onwards. Astronomers wanted ever-larger apertures (lens or mirror diameters), and it is difficult to make refracting telescopes beyond lens sizes of about one meter as a lens is only supported at the rim, leading to the heavy center of the lens sagging under gravity, distorting the lens's shape and optical properties.",

The magnitude and direction of the change depends on the \"indices of refraction\" of the two media, which in turn depend on the speed of light in each medium, a relation that is encoded mathematically in Snell's law of refraction. The way that light passes into a piece of glass can be used to create a lens, which bundles parallel light rays – such as the light of a distant star – falling onto the lens. This is the main effect used in constructing refracting telescopes. Refraction also depends on the wavelength of the infalling light, a fact that can be used as in a prism, to separate light by wavelength into its constituent elementary colors – which is important for documenting and examining spectra.",

Some of that structure comes about through interaction with Saturn's larger moons, and two gaps are opened up by tiny moons orbiting inside them.

More massive objects exert larger tidal forces while tidal forces are stronger for objects that are closer together. These tidal forces can become so strong that the stretching can rip one of the objects to shreds.\n\nFor an object (e.g. an asteroid or moon) of a particular mass and size close to another massive object there is a distance within which it will be torn to pieces by the other object's tidal forces. This distance is known as the \"Roche limit\".\n\nA common example of the Roche limit is rocky and icy moons orbiting giant planets. If a moon is closer to the giant planet than the Roche limit then it will disintegrate, forming a ring of material around the giant planet.\n\nChains of craters called \"catenae\" visible on the Moon and other rocky bodies in the Solar System are evidence for incoming asteroids breaking up as they pass the Roche limit, leading them to impact as a string of smaller objects, rather than one large body.",

    "Term": "Scientific Method",
    "Definition": "Often inaccurately portrayed as a linear process, in reality the scientific method is dynamic, and layered. There is no universal or fixed scientific method, and the methods that scientists use to explore the physical world vary. Key aspects of a scientific approach include the importance and requirement of empirical data to support theories, and that the results should be reproducible and checked by other researchers. Scientific method encompasses a range of methodological approaches underpinned by philosophical principles, and may have some defining characteristics like experimentation, systematic observation, or evidence-based explanations, but is not limited to these. There is no single, universal way of doing science, and the aims of the research guide the method. Nature is complex, and one universal method of inquiry will not be able to adequately unravel its mysteries.",

    "Term": "Scientific Model",
    "Definition": "Scientific models can be physical, mathematical, conceptual, or analogic, and they aim to represent and/or explain some aspect(s) of a process, system, or phenomena. Scientific models can also be used to make predictions, although that does not mean models that do not make predictions are not scientific. Scientific models are not always meant to be \"factual\" representations of the world, but rather they are tools for allowing us to explore concepts that would otherwise be abstract, intangible, and challenging to understand. One example is the geocentric model: although it does not represent the reality of the Solar System, it is used when discussing ideas related to the celestial sphere. Sometimes multiple models may be required to fully explain a concept.",
