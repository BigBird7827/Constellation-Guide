    "Term": "A-type Star",
    "Definition": "A star with spectral type \"A\". Astronomers identify A-type stars by the presence of strong absorption lines from hydrogen in their spectra. They have typical (effective) temperatures between around 7400 kelvins (K) and 10,000 K. Compared to other stars, they appear white or bluish white to human eyes unless affected by interstellar or atmospheric reddening. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, and Vega, the star against which all other stars' brightnesses are measured in the apparent magnitude scale, are A-type stars.",

    "Term": "Absolute Magnitude",
    "Definition": "Absolute magnitude is a measure with two different definitions. Both relate to how bright objects appear under a special set of conditions. This allows the intrinsic properties of objects at different distances to be compared. This is in contrast to apparent magnitude which is a measure of how bright an object appears from the location of the observer.\n\nFor objects outside the Solar System such as stars and galaxies, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object would have when viewed from a standard distance of 10 parsecs, ignoring the effects of interstellar extinction. This standardized number allows different objects to be compared by how intrinsically bright they are.\n\nWithin the Solar System, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object such as an asteroid would have if viewed at a distance of one astronomical unit from the observer, while the object is at a distance of one astronomical unit away from the Sun, and at opposition. Note that an object in the Solar System can never match these conditions when viewed from Earth but the definition removes factors that depend on the locations of the object and the observer to allow Solar System objects in different locations to be compared.",

    "Term": "Absolute Zero",
    "Definition": "Absolute zero is the zero point of the kelvin temperature scale, corresponding to -273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale and -459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale. This choice of zero point is motivated by fundamental physics: for a classical system, the temperature of absolute zero would correspond to a state where all of the particles are at perfect rest, each with kinetic energy zero. In the real world, basic effects of quantum theory mean that this state of complete rest will never be reached.\n\nIn the language of thermodynamics, which describes general systems and their abilities to exchange heat and other forms of energy, an idealized system at temperature absolute zero would be a system from which no heat could be extracted at all. In practice, it is impossible to bring a system into that ideal state. This is codified by the so-called 3rd law of thermodynamics, also called Nernst's theorem: we can get arbitrarily close to absolute zero, but we can never reach it.",

    "Term": "Absorption Line",
    "Definition": "A rainbow forms when water droplets split light into elementary colors, from purple, blue, and green, to yellow, orange, and red. Each color corresponds to a range of wavelengths, and the rainbow colors are arranged in order of increasing wavelength from violet to red. This kind of decomposed light, or more generally of electromagnetic radiation, by wavelength is called a spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is a mixture of light particles called \"photons\". Creating a spectrum amounts to sorting photons by energy and documenting how many photons there are in each given energy range. By a basic law of quantum mechanics, this is equivalent to sorting light by frequency – yet another way of documenting a spectrum.\n\nIf the amount of energy varies smoothly with wavelength (or photon energy, or frequency), the spectrum is called continuous. In contrast, sharp dips or peaks in a spectrum at certain wavelengths are called absorption and emission lines, respectively. Such lines arise due to transitions between different energy levels within atoms or molecules (or even atomic nuclei), either absorbing or emitting radiation at specific wavelengths. For example, in visible light, stars show continuous spectra with absorption lines. The lines carry information about a star's chemical composition. The analysis of spectra is known as spectroscopy; instruments that allow for the recording of spectra are called spectroscopes, spectrometers, or spectrographs.",

    "Definition": "In the late 1990s, measurements of the light emitted from Type Ia supernovae (a class of exploding star), located in very distant galaxies showed that they appeared fainter than expected for a universe with a constant rate (speed) of expansion. The measurements were consistent with the scenario for a universe where the rate of expansion was accelerating. The cause for the accelerated expansion is attributed to dark energy, the nature of which is still unknown and a topic of current research. The accelerated expansion is occurring on very large scales and has no significant effect in individual gravitationally bound galaxies.",

    "Term": "Accretion Disk",
    "Definition": "When an astrophysical object accretes matter, unless the in-falling matter is already moving straight towards the attracting object, it cannot fall directly onto it. Indeed as the in-falling object moves closer to the attracting object, the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the line between it and the attracting object increases due to conservation of angular momentum.\n\nIn many cases, in-falling matter will collect in what is called an accretion disk: a swirling disk of gas and dust surrounding the attracting object. From the inner rim of the disk, matter can fall onto the central object. For a compact central object, matter falling onto the accretion disk will have gained an enormous amount of energy while falling. As this energy is deposited in the disk, the disk can heat up to temperatures of hundreds of thousands or even millions of kelvins. Accretion disks around the supermassive black holes in the center of some galaxies provide the power for active galactic nuclei (AGN). These extremely bright objects can be brighter than all the stars in their host galaxy combined.\n\nAccretion disks are found in a variety of astrophysical situations such as around supermassive black holes, stellar remnants, gamma ray bursts, or protostars.",

    "Definition": "An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a very luminous region at the center of a galaxy. It is thought to be powered by a supermassive black hole which accretes surrounding matter, forming an extremely hot accretion disk around it. AGNs have quite complex structures, with many different regions that emit light with different characteristics, and are often surrounded by a donut-shaped torus of dusty material. An AGN sometimes sends out jets of material in opposite directions. While many galaxies have a supermassive black hole in the center, not all are accreting matter and hence not all are AGN.\n\nAGN is a general term that includes objects such as quasars, blazars, Seyfert galaxies, and radio galaxies. The different observational properties of these types of objects are thought to result in part from AGNs being viewed from different angles.",

    "Term": "Adaptive Optics",
    "Definition": "When you look up at night, you might see the stars twinkle. The air in the atmosphere is always in motion, and as light from a star passes through a region with turbulence, it gets deflected by a varying amount. That is why what we can see in the sky is not a single steady point of light for each star, but a dancing, ever-changing, distorted succession of points. For astronomers, twinkling means that they cannot take images of celestial objects in as much detail as their large ground-based telescopes would otherwise allow. Adaptive optics is a way of mitigating that effect. Using either a real star or a laser-projected \"artificial star\", an adaptive optics (\"AO\") system monitors atmospheric distortion in real time. Light that has entered the telescope is guided onto a deformable mirror. Controlled by a computer, that mirror is continuously deformed in just the right way to counteract atmospheric distortion.",

That angle measures how high an object is above the horizon – if you point your finger at the object, and then move that finger straight down to the horizon, the direction of your arm will have changed by the angle that is the altitude. Altitude is measured either in degrees or in radians. An object on the horizon would have an altitude of 0°, and an object that is directly overhead, \"at the zenith,\" would have an altitude of 90°. Negative altitude values are assigned to objects that are currently below the horizon – there, the altitude angle measures how far the object is below the horizon. An object that is straight below your feet, \"at the nadir,\" would have an altitude of –90°.\n\nIn other contexts, such as aviation or atmospheric physics, the altitude is a measure of how high a place is above some given reference level.

The major axis of that apparent-motion ellipse, expressed as an angle, corresponds to twice the object's so-called (annual) parallax angle. The parallax angle corresponds to a change in observer position by one astronomical unit (AU), that is, by the average Earth–Sun distance, or the Earth's displacement between two astronomical observations performed half a year apart.

    "Definition": "There are two meanings of the word Apollo in astronomy. The first refers to the Apollo program that put the first human beings on the surface of the Moon. These missions were mostly powered by the Saturn V rocket. In total there were fourteen numbered missions launched (Apollo 4–17); eleven missions were crewed with nine of these going to the Moon, of which six made lunar landings with the other three orbiting the Moon.\n\nOn the other hand, a group of near-Earth asteroids is also known as Apollo, named after the asteroid (1862) Apollo. This group of asteroids is characterized as having a semi-major axis greater than the Earth–Sun distance of one astronomical unit (AU) and with perihelion distances less than 1 AU. This means that during their orbits, Apollo asteroids move from inside the Earth's orbit to outside the Earth's orbit although these asteroids rarely come close to the Earth itself.",

    "Term": "Apparent Magnitude",
    "Definition": "Apparent magnitude is a measure of how bright a celestial body appears to an observer. For historical reasons, the magnitude scale assigns larger numbers to fainter objects. Magnitude is a logarithmic scale with a difference of five magnitudes corresponding to a factor of 100 in measured brightness. There are many magnitude scales because brightness can be measured at different wavelengths and with different techniques. The common \"visual magnitude\" scale is set so that the bright star Vega has an apparent magnitude of zero. On this scale, Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, has magnitude -1.46, and the magnitudes of the Sun and the full Moon are -26.7 and -12.7, respectively. The negative numbers indicate that these objects appear brighter than Vega. In very dark conditions, people with excellent vision can see stars up to about visual magnitude 6. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field reaches a visual magnitude near 31. This is about 100 to the power five or 10,000,000,000 times fainter than magnitude 6.",

Asteroids are solid bodies of various compositions: a number of them are rich in carbon, some contain more rocky material (silicates), and others are mainly composed of metals.\n\nMost asteroids are piles of rubble bound together by gravity, with bumpy, uneven shapes. Some asteroids have moons – other small asteroids which orbit them.\n\nAsteroids are smaller than dwarf planets (which have enough mass for gravity to pull them into a nearly round shape). They are larger than meteoroids; the lower size limit of an asteroid is commonly set at between one and 10 meters across. If heating by the Sun or star causes the small body to emit gas and dust, the body is a comet and not an asteroid (although the distinction is not always clear).\n\nHistorically, the name asteroid was given to any astronomical body that orbits the Sun that was too small to resolve with a telescope. As they appeared as star-like points through a telescope they were named asteroids after the Greek word for star-like.",

Surveys covering small areas or \"pencil-beam\" surveys can concentrate more time observing one part of the sky and thus can detect fainter objects than some wider surveys.\n\nAstronomical surveys may cover specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as radio waves or the infrared, or may combine data from different wavelength ranges.\n\nSome astronomical surveys make repeated observations of the same part of the sky allowing the scientific study of the movement of objects across the sky and of the change in brightness of astronomical objects or the appearance of transient objects such as supernovae. By measuring the yearly change in the positions, astronomers can also calculate the distance of the objects using parallax.

In contrast, atoms according to the modern definition are made up of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Protons and neutrons form the atomic nucleus. All atoms of a given chemical element have the same number of protons, uniquely characteristic for that element. The atomic nucleus is surrounded by electrons. As the term is commonly used, atoms are electrically neutral, with as many protons (each with unit positive electric charge) as electrons (each with unit negative charge). When electrons are taken away from, or added to, this neutral configuration, an atom becomes an ion.\n\nThe electron shell determines the chemical properties of an atom. The differences and similarities between the different kinds of atoms are organized and classified in the periodic table of chemical elements. The electron shell also determines how an atom interacts with radiation. The resulting features in the spectrum of light received from astronomical objects allow astronomers to identify the different kinds of atoms in space.",

    "Term": "Big Bang Nucleosynthesis",
    "Definition": "Nucleosynthesis refers to processes where heavier atomic nuclei are formed from lighter ones via nuclear fusion. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), sometimes called Primordial Nucleosynthesis, is a brief instance of nucleosynthesis during our Universe's hot and dense Big Bang phase, nearly 14 billion years ago. According to our current cosmological models, BBN began in the first few seconds of the early Universe and lasted for a few minutes. The timing is directly linked to the rate at which the early Universe was expanding and cooling down. Earlier than those first seconds, the Universe had been too hot for nuclei more complex than hydrogen to survive. At the end of those few minutes, the Universe was not hot and dense enough for nuclear fusion to continue. After the end of BBN, about 25% by mass of atomic nuclei was in the form of helium-4 (a particularly stable isotope of helium), and 75% was hydrogen. Closer inspection shows that there must also have been small traces of deuterium (a hydrogen isotope), helium-3 (another helium isotope), and isotopes of lithium: lithium-6 and lithium-7. The amounts of each element produced during BBN depend only on basic cosmological parameters, and thus constitute a prediction of the cosmological models. Given that over the following nearly 14 billion years, significant additional nucleosynthesis has taken place, notably in the interiors of stars, it is a challenge to try and estimate initial element abundances from present-day observational data. For helium-4, helium-3, deuterium, and lithium-6, the cosmological BBN predictions agree very well with the reconstructions from observations. For lithium-7, there is a marked difference, but it is not clear at this time whether that indicates a problem with our understanding of BBN or a problem with the attempts to estimate the initial lithium-7 abundance.",

We see evidence of this expansion today in the Hubble Diagram.\n\nBecause our current tools do not allow astronomers to look back directly to the beginning of the Universe, much of what we understand about the Big Bang theory comes to us from mathematical models and theories.

Due to their enormous distances from Earth, most binary stars and higher order multiple-star systems appear to the observer as a single star.\n\nBinaries can be classified into a number of categories according to the observational method by which they were found to be binary stars. They may simultaneously belong to more than one category:\n\nVisual binaries can be observed as two separate stars close together on the sky. Not all stars that appear close on the sky (double stars) are binaries bound by gravity, some may just be close on the sky by coincidence but not bound by gravity. Double stars that are not binary stars bound by gravity can be separated by hundreds of light years in distance.\n\nSpectroscopic binaries are found due to the Doppler shift of the lines in the stars' spectrum as the stars orbit their common center of mass.\n\nEclipsing binaries can be detected when one of the component stars passes between its companion star and an observer, blocking some of the light from the companion star and causing the combined light of the system to look briefly dimmer.\n\nAstrometric binaries are systems where only one stellar image is observed – either due to one of the stars being too faint to be observed or the two stars' images being blended together – but where the orbital motion of the stars in the binary system causes the brightest point of the stellar image to show a periodic change in position on the sky.",

These different measures of brightness can be defined over the whole spectrum the object emits in or in specific areas of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nFor historical reasons, astronomers describe the brightness of an object using the so-called magnitude system which is a logarithmic system and gives lower numbered values to brighter stars.\n\nChanges in brightness can allow us to reconstruct physical processes, e.g. when a star grows and becomes brighter, or a darker object passes in front of a brighter one.",

    "Term": "Brown Dwarf",
    "Definition": "A brown dwarf is an object too low in mass to be a star but too high in mass to be a planet. Stars are fueled by hydrogen fusion in their cores. Brown dwarfs have internal temperatures that are too low to sustain hydrogen fusion. However, early in their lifetime brown dwarfs are able to briefly fuse deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen. This deuterium fusion is used to distinguish brown dwarfs from planets but is hard to observe. Brown dwarfs typically have masses between 1.2% and 8% of the mass of the Sun (around 12–80 times the mass of Jupiter) and are roughly the same physical size as Jupiter. Young brown dwarfs have similar temperatures in their outer regions (effective temperature) to low mass stars (red dwarfs) but lacking internal heat sources they cool as they age, with some cooling to a few hundred degrees Celsius.",

It is an abstract system based on the periodic motion of celestial objects (Moon, Sun, stars). Calendars have been used since ancient times. The Moon and the Sun were two objects in the sky which had easily identifiable periodic motions that resulted in identifiable changes in the passing of days, weeks, months, and seasons. Calendars can be based on the monthly lunar cycle (lunar calendars), based on the solar year (solar calendars), or be lunar calendars with additional days added to match the solar year (lunisolar calendars). There are a wonderful variety of calendars throughout the world resulting from local astronomical heritage.",

An important feature of Cepheids is that their period is closely related to their luminosity. This is the famous period–luminosity relationship revealed by Henrietta Leavitt in 1908. Using this relationship, the absolute brightness of a Cepheid can be calculated from the pulsation period. The difference between the easily observable apparent brightness and absolute brightness derived from the relationship is indicative of the distance of both the given Cepheid and the external galaxy hosting this variable star. Thus Cepheids are primary distance indicators in establishing the cosmic distance scale.",

    "Term": "Circumpolar Stars",
    "Definition": "In most locations on Earth, either the celestial North Pole or the celestial South Pole is visible in the sky at some distance above the horizon. For an observer at such a location, the stars appear to rotate around the celestial pole as time passes: Each star traces a circle in the sky, with the circle centered on the celestial pole to which Earth's axis points. At the two points where a circle crosses the observer's horizon, one eastern and the other western, the star in question will rise and set, respectively. For stars that are close enough to the celestial pole, the traced-out circle will be completely above the horizon. Our observer will never see those stars either rise or set. Those never-setting stars are called circumpolar stars.\n\nWhich stars are circumpolar depends on the observer's geographic latitude and on the star's declination – the latter is the angle between the star's location and the celestial equator. In the northern hemisphere, a star is circumpolar if its declination is larger than 90° minus the observer's latitude. In the southern hemisphere, we need to take into account that both southern latitudes on Earth and southern declination values have a minus sign. Taking these signs into account, on the southern hemisphere, a star is circumpolar if its declination is smaller than –90° minus the observer's latitude.",

It is made up of dust particles released from the surface, which follow the comet along its orbit around the Sun. Dust tails can be millions of kilometers or more in length. They reflect sunlight, and if the conditions are right, their whitish, diffuse shape accounts for most of what can be observed when a comet is visible to the naked eye.\n\nA substantial fraction of the gas is blown away and ionized by the solar wind – the electrically charged particles emitted by the Sun.

    "Term": "Convective Zone",
    "Definition": "The convective zone is a region in a star where convection, rather than radiation is the main method of heat transportation. Convection requires a large difference of temperatures along a given region. When radiation is inefficient, convection sets in.\n\nIn the convective zone, hot material deeper in the star rises up to cooler regions where it cools and then sinks back down. In the most massive main sequence stars the stellar core is convective while the outer layers are radiative. In main sequence stars similar to the Sun, the region below the atmosphere is convective while the region deeper than this is radiative. In the lowest mass stars, the entire star, from the core to just below the atmosphere, is convective.\n\nConvective motions result in large scale mixing of chemical elements. When convection reaches the surface of a star, it can transport freshly synthesized elements and isotopes to the surface, which leaves an imprint in the spectra recorded by astronomers.",

This \"heliocentric\" model stated the planets orbit the Sun and replaced the previously held belief that the Earth was in a special place in the center of the Solar System. Philosophically, the Copernican Principle represents a fundamental shift in the human perception of our place in the Universe. This shift was revolutionary in the time of Copernicus. The Copernican Principle has been extended to cosmology where it is called the Cosmological Principle, which provides one of the key foundations of modern cosmology – there is no special location or direction within the observable Universe. Both principles are constantly being tested through a range of observations at various scales, using ground and space-based telescopes.",

    "Definition": "The corona of a star is a region of extremely hot, low-density plasma surrounding the star's atmosphere, which can stretch millions of kilometers into space. Every star with a reasonably strong magnetic field, produced by a dynamo effect as charged matter moves inside the star, is expected to have a corona. Naked-eye observation of our Sun's corona is possible during a total solar eclipse, when the solar corona becomes visible as a whitish, irregularly shaped area surrounding the hidden solar disk. More generally, the shape of a star's corona is determined by the star's magnetic fields and the outward pressure of gas in its upper regions. Stellar coronas have very high temperatures: At more than a million kelvins, the solar corona is much hotter than the Sun's surface. The mechanism for heating the corona to that temperature is the subject of ongoing research, but it seems clear that the magnetic fields threading the corona play a major role. The shape of the Sun's corona changes on timescales between seconds and months, mostly in response to solar activity, such as flares ejecting plasma into the corona, or coronal mass ejections releasing a considerable amount of charged particles. It also changes on a timescale of years with what is called the solar cycle – the periodic change in strength and orientation of the Sun's magnetic field, with a period of nearly eleven years. Changes of this kind are expected to occur in an analogous fashion in other stars' coronas, as well.",

Before the CMB was released, the interaction of photons with free electrons prevented light from traveling long distances. The expansion and cooling of the Universe allowed free electrons to combine with protons to form atomic hydrogen, and allowed light to travel through the Universe. The expansion has subsequently stretched the wavelength of these photons, making them detectable today in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum.",

The first quarter phase (when half of the moon appears to be illuminated, this is popularly known as half moon) occurs at 90 degrees from the start point. The illuminated portion of the Moon continues to increase, becoming gibbous (convex-shaped, or bulging-shaped). Full moon occurs at 180 degrees. After this point, the shape gradually starts decreasing (waning phase), resulting in a gibbous moon, the last quarter phase (when half of the moon appears to be illuminated, this is popularly known as half moon) at 270 degrees from the start, the crescent moon, and ending as a new moon at 360 degrees.

When a celestial object in the sky crosses the meridian it is at either its highest or lowest point in the sky.\n\nFrom the observer's perspective the celestial sphere appears to rotate around the Earth. This means that celestial objects on the sky follow a circular path during the course of a day. Most objects rise in the east, move higher in the sky until they cross the meridian, and then move lower in the sky to set in the west. Circumpolar objects are objects that are close enough to one of the celestial poles that an observer could see their full circular path over one sidereal day (a little less than 24 hours). In all cases the highest point in the sky a celestial object reaches is when it crosses the meridian. The instant when it reaches this highest point is referred to as its upper culmination. Twelve (sidereal) hours later, when the object is at its lowest point in the sky (often this is below the horizon), this instant is referred to as its lower culmination.\n\nAs culmination is the moment when a celestial object crosses the observer's local meridian it is often referred to as a meridian transit or meridian passage. The hour angle on the sky is defined relative to the observer's local meridian, hence by definition upper culmination happens at an hour angle of zero and lower culmination happens at an hour angle of 12 hours.",

    "Term": "Dark Matter",
    "Definition": "Dark matter is a proposed form of matter that has mass, but is completely transparent and does not emit light. It has been postulated as a joint explanation for a variety of phenomena related to gravitational interactions.\n\nEarly evidence for the existence of dark matter came from galaxies in galaxy clusters, which were found to be moving at comparatively high speeds. Postulating additional mass served to explain why, in spite of their speeds, the galaxies in question were gravitationally bound to their cluster instead of escaping. Measurements by Vera Rubin and others of the speeds at which stars and gas orbit in disk galaxies led to a wider acceptance of the concept of dark matter: there, the usual laws of gravity require considerable mass in addition to the visible matter in order to explain the observed high rotation speeds. More recently, gravitational lensing observations have indicated considerable non-luminous mass in galaxy clusters.\n\nIn cosmology, the expansion history of the Universe points to there being more matter in the Universe than is accounted for in the form of luminous matter. The common explanation for the growth of structure in the early Universe also relies on the presence of dark matter. For these reasons, the standard cosmological models are referred to as \"Lambda CDM models\", where CDM stands for cold (slow-moving) dark matter.\n\nThe nature of dark matter is a topic of intense research and debate both in cosmology and particle physics. Evidence for dark matter remains indirect, relying on observations of the effects of dark matter's mass on luminous matter or light. Several proposals exist for species of as yet undetected elementary particles that could make up dark matter, but the experiments set up to find direct evidence for such candidate particles have not so far been successful. There are also alternative proposed explanations that claim to account for the relevant observations without the involvement of new particle species.",

A day by this definition is shorter in the winter and longer in the summer in the northern hemisphere, while the opposite holds for the southern hemisphere. In the far north or the far south, there is a time of year where the Sun does not set at all – directly at the poles, the Sun is up for six months without setting!\n\n\"Day\" is also the name of the 24-hour unit of time we use in the calendar. Astronomically speaking, the time from one local noon to the next – that is, from the day's highest position of the Sun above the horizon from one day to the next – is called an apparent solar day. The length of local days varies depending on the time of year, owing to the facts that (a) Earth's orbit is elliptical (with Earth moving faster when it is closer to the Sun), and that (b) the apparent trajectory of the Sun in the sky is at different angles relative to Earth's equator. For practical purposes, timekeeping instead uses the average length of apparent solar days, which are called mean solar days. The associated time at 24 hours per day is called mean solar time.\n\nA sidereal day is based on the \"fixed\" background stars on the celestial sphere. It is the period between the time a \"fixed\" star reaches its highest point in the sky to the next time it reaches its highest point in the sky. One sidereal day lasts approximately 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds.

    "Term": "Degree",
    "Definition": "In mathematics a degree (symbol °) is a measure of angle. One degree is 1/360th of a full circle. It can be expressed as a decimal number or it can be divided into arcminutes (symbol ′) where 60′ is 1°, and arcseconds (symbol ″) where 60″ is 1′. One arcsecond is 1/3600th of a degree, an extremely small angle.\n\nDegrees measure the apparent size of an object (see angular diameter) and its position on the celestial sphere. See also: declination, right ascension, altitude, and azimuth. On Earth: latitude and longitude. They are also used to measure angular distance between objects on the celestial sphere. The width of your fist at arm’s length is about 10°; from the horizon to the zenith is 90°. Depending on the scale, a telescope’s resolution and field-of-view can be expressed in degrees, arcminutes, or arcseconds.\n\nAlternate meaning: A unit in the measure of temperature, used with the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales. The Celsius scale is defined by the freezing point of water at sea level being 0°C and the boiling point of water being 100°C. A change of one degree Celsius is the same as a change of one kelvin but they have different zero points. The zero point of the kelvin scale is absolute zero, the lowest temperature, -273.15°C. In the older Fahrenheit system a change of one degree is the same as a change of 5/9ths of a degree Celsius or kelvin.",

The higher the density, the greater the mass per unit volume. The average density of an object is its total mass divided by its total volume. Its SI unit is kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3).\n\nDensities in the region of the Milky Way around the Sun can range from about 10-20 kg/m3 for interstellar gas to more than 1017 kg/m3 for the interiors of neutron stars.\n\nEveryday densities on Earth fall between those extremes, with iron at about 7800 kg/m3, water at around 1000 kg/m3 and the air that surrounds us at sea-level at a bit more than 1 kg/m3.\n\nThe Universe includes not just the stars, planets, and gas in galaxies, but also the relatively empty space between galaxies and between clusters of galaxies. This leads to an average density of matter in the Universe of the order of 10-27 kg/m3.",

The two locations where the axis and the Earth's surface intersect define the geographic North Pole at a latitude of 90°N and the geographic South Pole at a latitude of 90°S. In contrast, the equator is an imaginary line where a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis intersects with the Earth's surface at the greatest distance from the axis. The equator has a latitude of 0°.\n\nThe geographic poles are not at the same places as the Earth's magnetic North and South Poles – the magnetic poles are defined as the locations on the surface where Earth's magnetic field points straight down and straight up, respectively.\n\nEarth's orbit has an axis as well: The direction perpendicular to Earth's orbital plane. Earth's axis is inclined by an angle of 23.4° against that orbital axis. This tilt is the cause of Earth's seasons. In particular, over the course of one orbit, there are phases where the northern hemisphere or the southern one are tilted toward the Sun, thus receiving more light.\n\nRelative to the most distant celestial objects, the direction Earth's axis points towards changes slowly over time, in what is called Earth's axial precession. Currently, the Earth's axis intersects the celestial sphere close to Polaris, the North Star. But over roughly 26,000 years, that intersection point describes a small circle in the sky.

This is the physical basis of chemistry. In white dwarf stars, quantum properties of electrons provide the necessary pressure to keep such stellar remnants from collapsing under their own gravity.",

    "Term": "Ellipse",
    "Definition": "An ellipse is a two-dimensional shape that resembles a squashed or elongated circle. The widest distance across an ellipse is called the major axis and the shortest distance is called the minor axis. An ellipse has two foci (plural of focus) that lie along the major axis with both having the same distance from the widest points. At any point on the ellipse, the sum of the distances to the two foci is constant. The eccentricity, e, of an ellipse defines how squashed it is and lies within the range 0\nA closed orbit such as the Earth's orbit around the Sun follows the shape of an ellipse. An orbit is characterized by the semi-major axis (half the size of the major axis) and eccentricity, but to fully describe an orbit the orientation of the ellipse also needs to be known.\n\nUnclosed orbits such as comets that make only one visit to the inner Solar System before being flung out into interstellar space follow parabolas (e=1) or hyperbolas (e>1).",

    "Definition": "In very basic terms energy is defined as the capacity of a system to do some work. However, this definition does not capture the rich, multilayered aspect of energy, and its manifestation from the scale of fundamental particles to the entire Universe. One of the fundamental principles of physics is that total energy is always conserved. Energy takes various forms (e.g. kinetic, gravitational potential, thermal) depending on the context and can be converted from one form to another. Relativistic physics describes an innate connection between mass and energy. The unit of energy is the joule, and it quantifies the amount of work done on an object by a force of one newton moving it a distance of one meter. In particle physics, however, energy is expressed in electron volts.",

On the day of an equinox, daytime and nighttime are of approximately equal duration all over the planet, rather than just near to the equator. To an observer on Earth, the Sun rises exactly from the cardinal point east and moves, apparently, along the line of the celestial equator during that day, setting exactly in the west. There are two equinoxes per year, one around March 20 and one around September 23. When the equinox is in March, it indicates the apparent passage of the Sun towards the northern hemisphere; in the September equinox the apparent passage of the Sun is to the south.",

    "Term": "Escape Velocity",
    "Definition": "Escape velocity is the minimum speed that an object must have to permanently escape from the gravitational field of a celestial body. This is a scalar quantity so should more correctly be referred to as escape speed; however, the term escape velocity is commonly used. The simplest case is that of a body that is spherically symmetric – which is an excellent approximation for describing stars and planets. In this case, the escape velocity at a distance r from the center of a body of mass m, is given by √(2Gm/r), where G is the gravitational constant. At the surface of a spherical body the distance from its center is its radius. This means that the escape velocity at the surface of an approximately spherical celestial body depends on the radius and its mass. In the case of the Sun, it is 617.5 kilometers per second (km/s), and for Earth, 11.2 km/s. It is 2.4 km/s for the Moon, which means that an object on the Moon needs to attain a lower speed to escape the Moon's gravity than an object on Earth would need to leave Earth's gravity.",

Extinction could be due to Earth's atmosphere (called atmospheric extinction), material in the immediate vicinity of a star (called circumstellar extinction), or due to material between stars in deep space (called interstellar extinction). The atmospheric extinction is mainly due to aerosols and molecules present in Earth's atmosphere such as water, carbon dioxide, and ozone at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Interstellar extinction is attributed to interstellar matter made up of gas and submicron-sized dust particles. Interstellar dust has a drastic effect on starlight as compared to the gas particles. Extinction is generally higher at shorter wavelengths and vice-versa making astronomical objects appear redder than their true color (reddening).",

Going by the available evidence, the necessary conditions for the emergence of life on Earth – a solid planet, at a distance from its star where liquid water can exist on the planet's surface, atoms like carbon and oxygen, and the conditions to form more complex molecules – should exist on numerous other planets within our Galaxy and beyond. It is not an unreasonable assumption that intelligent life might have arisen at least on some of those planets, although we have no solid basis for estimating the probability of that happening.\n\nSome astronomers have used radio signals to search for putative messages as part of a Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).

Closest to Jupiter is Io, which has hundreds of active volcanoes. The main reason for Io's vulcanism is that Io is getting \"kneaded\" by the tidal effects of Jupiter's gravity. Europa's entire surface is covered with ice. Under the ice is believed to be an ocean of liquid water which is one of the best candidates for harboring life outside of Earth in the Solar System. Ganymede is the largest moon in our Solar System, and also the moon with the largest mass, at twice the mass of Earth's Moon. Callisto is almost exactly the same size as the planet Mercury, but has only about one third of Mercury's mass.\n\nThe four Galilean moons were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610, as one of several discoveries in Galilei's pioneering campaign of using a telescope for astronomical observations. Galilei was able to document that, over time, the four moons orbit Jupiter like a miniature solar system. This was a clear demonstration that astronomical objects can orbit a center other than the Earth; this observation played an important role in the shifting of the scientific consensus from the Earth-centered (geocentric) to the Sun-centered (heliocentric) view of the Solar System.",

    "Term": "Galilean Telescope",
    "Definition": "In a refracting telescope, light first encounters a convex lens (converging lens), called the objective lens, which serves to bundle infalling parallel light rays. Such almost perfectly parallel light rays correspond to light we receive from a distant object, such as a star. In order to produce an image that can be observed by eye, those converging rays must be made parallel again. This is the task of an additional optical element: the eyepiece, which is where you put your eye if you observe through a telescope.\n\nIn a Galilean telescope, named after the model of telescope built by Galileo Galilei in 1609 and used for some of the first systematic astronomical telescope observations, this is achieved by inserting a concave lens (diverging lens) as the eyepiece.\n\nIn contrast, in a Keplerian telescope, invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, the converging light rays are allowed to cross, and the resulting divergent light rays are then made parallel using a second convex lens. Compared to a Keplerian telescope, a Galilean telescope provides a visual image that is upright (not inverted), but it has a much narrower field of view than a Keplerian telescope.\n\nThe wider field of view is why nearly all modern refracting telescopes used by amateur astronomers are Keplerian in design – in the case of particularly high-quality telescopes, Keplerian with additional lenses providing improved image quality. For professional astronomy, the distinction between Keplerian and Galilean is largely irrelevant: professional observations use cameras instead of eye pieces, and most professional telescopes are reflective (mirror) telescopes, not refracting telescopes.",

Gravitational lensing is most apparent for very massive objects such as galaxies or galaxy clusters. If observers on Earth are looking at a distant object whose light is thus bent (by \"the lens\"), the object will appear distorted. This distortion always implies light (de)magnification, typically allowing us to better see otherwise faint background objects. When the lens has enough mass concentrated in a small angular area, multiple images of the same background object are produced, each having its light reaching the observer at different times. Measuring these so-called \"time delays\" is one of the best ways to determine the value of the Hubble Constant on extragalactic scales. Multiple images from a lens, on the other hand, allow us to precisely determine its mass (using modelling); this is a very useful method for finding the mass of galaxies and, especially, galaxy clusters.",

    "Term": "Halley's Comet",
    "Definition": "Halley's comet is, arguably, the most famous comet because it is the only short-cycle comet visible to the naked eye from Earth with a period short enough (about 75 years) to potentially allow people to see it twice in their lives. The comet's last visit was in 1986, and it is expected to return in 2061. It is named after the English astronomer Edmond Halley who was the first to calculate its periodicity and predict its next visit. Halley noticed that the comets that appeared in the years 1531, 1607, and 1682 all had very similar orbits and thus were all visits of the same comet to the inner Solar System. He correctly predicted the comet's return in 1758.\n\nIt has been visited by the Vega and Giotto space missions. These found that the comet's dust consists mainly of silicates, iron, and magnesium, in addition to carbon–hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen compounds (CHON). The comet's nucleus is made mostly of ice.",

Just as refraction and reflection in water droplets causes rainbows, sunlight passing through ice crystals is reflected and refracted within them to form halos. Halos can take many different forms and can be caused by light from the Sun or the Moon. The 22-degree halo is a circular halo that forms as a thin band of light around the Sun or the Moon. The geometry of this halo is the result of the properties of the ice crystals that sunlight or moonlight passes through in the atmosphere.\n\nThe word halo is also used in other astronomical contexts, including: galactic halo, dark matter halo, and stellar halo, all of which are some of the major components in the structure of galaxies.",

This model of the Solar System places the Sun at the center and the planets orbit around it, replacing the geocentric (Earth-centered) model. Although the origin of the model is attributed to Copernicus in the 16th century, Aristarchus of Samos developed a heliocentric model in Ancient Greece and astronomers in India, Europe, and the Islamic world discussed such models prior to Copernicus. Observational evidence for the heliocentric model came through the telescopic observations of Venus made by Galileo. The original heliocentric model placed the Sun at the geometric center of the Solar System; this view changed with the mathematical formulations of Kepler using Tycho Brahe’s data, which Newton built on and expanded with his law of gravitation.",

    "Definition": "The Hertzsprung–Russell (or HR) diagram is a graph of two observational properties of stars: On the one axis, the total power emitted by stars (luminosity), and on the other axis either their effective temperature or spectral type. Where the effective temperature is used, it is shown on a logarithmic scale, increasing from right to left. The HR diagram is named after two scientists: Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell who first made different versions of this graph in order to understand the properties of stars. The data points corresponding to the so-called \"main sequence stars\" lie on a diagonal band from the upper left to lower right in this graph. Data points corresponding to giant stars lie above and to the right of the main-sequence band. White dwarfs lie below and to the left of the band.\n\nThe HR diagram can also be a useful framework for representing the evolution of a star over time. Once a star has formed it will be positioned on the main sequence of the HR diagram, and its temperature and luminosity will remain roughly constant for some time. Later, as it evolves, the star's temperature will drop and its luminosity will increase. This means the star's position on the HR diagram moves up and to the right, away from the main sequence towards the giant branch. A star's evolution, specifically its changes in temperature and luminosity, can be represented by a curve in the HR diagram. Thus a star's evolutionary state can be determined from its temperature and luminosity using the HR diagram.",

The boundary dividing what we can from what we cannot see is commonly called the horizon. In astronomy, that definition is refined as follows: Our own position on Earth defines a horizontal plane, which is perpendicular to the downwards direction (which we can make visible using a plumb line). The intersection of that plane with the celestial sphere defines our astronomical local horizon. The horizontal coordinate system makes use of the horizontal plane to define positions in the sky. The angle between our sightline to an object and the horizontal plane is called the object's altitude; the angle between the sightline's projection onto that plane and true north is called the object's azimuth.",

    "Term": "Hour Angle",
    "Definition": "The hour angle is the angle between an object's hour circle and the observer's meridian.\n\nAs seen from Earth, all the various positions in the sky together form what appears to be a distant sphere with Earth at its center. The points in the sky directly above Earth's equator form the celestial equator on that sphere. The point directly above Earth's geographic North Pole is the celestial North Pole, and that above Earth's South Pole, the celestial South Pole.\n\nJust like geographers define geographic longitude and latitude on Earth's surface, one can define longitude and latitude on the celestial sphere. The meridian of an observer corresponds to the observer's geographical meridian (the circle whose center is the Earth's center, and which intersects the North Pole, South Pole, and the observer's position), projected onto the celestial sphere. It intersects the north point on the observer's horizon, the zenith, and the south point. The projected meridian that passes through a given celestial object is called that object's hour circle. The hour angle is the angle between the object's hour circle and the observer's meridian. As time passes, the hour angle changes: An hour angle of zero corresponds to the star's highest position (its upper culmination) in the sky. As the star moves towards the western horizon, the hour angle increases. As the hour angle approaches 360 degrees, the star approaches its next upper culmination. Note the time between upper culminations is one sidereal day, this is roughly four minutes shorter than a solar day. Because of this direct connection with time, the hour angle is usually stated in hours, not in degrees, with 360 degrees corresponding to 24 hours. The hour angle can be used to compute the time until an object's upper culmination. This is useful to astronomers planning their observations: at or near upper culmination, when it is farthest from the horizon, is a particularly good time to observe an object.",

This is used as one line of evidence for an expanding Universe. The slope (gradient) of the line is referred to as the Hubble parameter (H), and the equation of the line is called the Hubble–Lemaître Law. The value of the Hubble parameter in the current era (13.8 billion years after the Big Bang) is called the Hubble constant (H₀). Modern iterations of the Hubble diagram, based on observations of Type Ia supernovae, plot distance modulus (indirect measure of distance using brightness) versus redshift.

    "Term": "Hydrogen Fusion",
    "Definition": "Nuclear fusion is the umbrella term for all reactions whereby lighter atomic nuclei collide and merge to form one or more heavier atomic nuclei. In astronomy, hydrogen fusion is the nuclear fusion reaction that transforms hydrogen nuclei (each consisting of a single proton) into helium-4 nuclei (each consisting of two protons and two neutrons bound together). The helium-4 nucleus has a mass less than the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons it is made of. By Einstein's famous formula E=mc2, that mass difference corresponds to an energy difference. As the protons and neutrons fuse to form helium-4, the amount of energy corresponding to that difference is released. In this way, hydrogen fusion serves as the energy source for so-called main sequence stars like our Sun. At least for some time, such stars are in an equilibrium state: the amount of energy released by hydrogen fusion in their cores corresponds to the energy those brightly-shining stars emit in the form of light and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation as well as particles.\n\nHydrogen fusion proceeds via several intermediate steps. For stars with the mass of our Sun or less, it proceeds via the so-called proton–proton chain (pp chain). In the simplest version of that chain of reactions, two hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse to yield deuterium nuclei (one proton, one neutron each), which then fuse with one additional hydrogen nucleus to yield helium-3 (two protons, one neutron). Two such helium-3 nuclei fuse to yield helium-4 plus two remaining hydrogen nuclei. In stars with more than about 1.3 times the mass of our Sun, an alternative process called the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen (CNO) cycle becomes the dominant way for fusing hydrogen into helium. Scientists on Earth have built machines to create fusion reactions with the hope that in future it can become a viable way of generating energy. Hydrogen fusion occurs not only in stars, but also took place during the early Big Bang phase of our Universe.",

Our Solar System lies in the disk of the Milky Way where most of the ISM is atomic hydrogen mixed with atomic helium and dust.\n\nThe ISM has a very low density compared to planetary atmospheres, with a typical density less than one particle per cubic centimeter, roughly 50 billion, billion times less dense than the Earth's atmosphere. This density varies greatly, along with the temperature, across the Galaxy with the ISM split into several different components.\n\nThe largest components by volume in the galactic disk are the warm atomic gas and warm ionized gas, both with temperatures around 8000 kelvins (K) and densities around half an atom or ion per cubic centimeter. A smaller volume is in the form of colder, denser atomic gas with a temperature around 40 K. A still smaller volume of the ISM is in the form of denser (up to a million molecules per cubic centimeter), colder (<20 K) clouds of molecular hydrogen. Some of these molecular clouds will collapse under their own gravity, leading to the formation of new stars. Molecular clouds in the Milky Way are mostly found in its spiral arms. The gas surrounding the Milky Way's disk is very hot (millions of kelvins) and very low density.\n\nStars put gas and dust back into the ISM through stellar winds and supernovae. The gas and dust returned to the ISM have a higher fraction of heavy elements (metals), thus enriching the galaxy over time. The gas and dust in the interstellar medium is the main cause of interstellar extinction.",

The second law says that the area covered by a line between the planet and the Sun is the same in a given time interval of the orbit. According to the third law, the square of the time (T2) a planet takes to move around the Sun is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a3, semi-major axis is a length which characterizes the size of the planet's orbit around the Sun). Kepler found these three laws by studying the observations of Mars carried out by his mentor Tycho Brahe.

    "Term": "Lower Culmination",
    "Definition": "In astronomy, culmination refers to the moment where a celestial object passes through the observer's local meridian. When a celestial object in the sky crosses the meridian it is at either its highest or lowest point in the sky.\n\nFrom the observer's perspective the celestial sphere appears to rotate around the Earth. This means that celestial objects on the sky follow a circular path during the course of a day. Most objects rise in the east, move higher in the sky until they cross the meridian, and then move lower in the sky to set in the west. Circumpolar objects are objects that are close enough to one of the celestial poles that an observer could see their full circular path over one sidereal day (a little less than 24 hours). In all cases the highest point in the sky a celestial object reaches is when it crosses the meridian. The instant when it reaches this highest point is referred to as its upper culmination. Twelve (sidereal) hours later, when the object is at its lowest point in the sky (often this is below the horizon), this instant is referred to as its lower culmination.\n\nAs culmination is the moment when a celestial object crosses the observer's local meridian it is often referred to as a meridian transit or meridian passage. The hour angle on the sky is defined relative to the observer's local meridian, hence by definition upper culmination happens at an hour angle of zero and lower culmination happens at an hour angle of 12 hours.",

Spectral type categorizes stars based on the appearance of their spectral lines. This roughly follows changes in temperature. The luminosity class categorizes stars based on how bright they are compared to other stars of their spectral type. Roman numerals are used to denote luminosity class: Stars on the main sequence burning hydrogen are classified as dwarfs (V). As an example, the class of the Sun is G2 V. Above these lie (in order of increasing size and brightness) subgiants (IV), giants (III), bright giants (II), and supergiants (Ib for less luminous and Ia for the most luminous). All of these are types of evolved stars that have finished burning hydrogen in their core. Metal poor subdwarfs are hydrogen burning stars with a low metal content that lie below the main sequence.

    "Term": "Lunar Phase",
    "Definition": "Lunar phase refers to the Moon's position in its orbit around the Earth. The changing position the Moon causes the changing shape of the illuminated portion of the Moon visible from Earth over the course of one lunar month. Half of the Moon is always, apart from during lunar eclipses, illuminated by the Sun. On Earth we see different parts of the Moon illuminated as it moves in its orbit around us. The lunar month starts and ends at the same phase. At a phase of 0 degrees, called \"new moon,\" the Moon is as close to the Sun as it will be on that orbit. At that phase, the illuminated side of the Moon faces away from Earth, and the Moon appears dark. The size of the illuminated part of the Moon gradually increases (waxing phase) becoming a crescent. The first quarter phase (when half of the moon appears to be illuminated, this is popularly known as half moon) occurs at 90 degrees from the start point. The illuminated portion of the Moon continues to increase, becoming gibbous (convex-shaped, or bulging-shaped). Full moon occurs at 180 degrees. After this point, the shape gradually starts decreasing (waning phase), resulting in a gibbous moon, the last quarter phase (when half of the moon appears to be illuminated, this is popularly known as half moon) at 270 degrees from the start, the crescent moon, and ending as a new moon at 360 degrees. Even though half the Moon appears illuminated at phases 90 and 270 degrees, the opposite sides are the ones illuminated.",

In turn, electrically charged particles moving through a magnetic field will experience a force unless they are travelling parallel to the field.\n\nIn astronomy, there are many situations where matter is ionized, its atoms split into charged particles (for hydrogen, protons, and electrons). The resulting plasma can produce, and interact with, magnetic fields.\n\nIn the interior of stars, moving plasma streams create a magnetic field through what is known as the dynamo effect. Near the star's surface, that magnetic field can lead to stellar activity, such as star spots or flares. A star's magnetic field can cause spots or flares at the stellar surface, and streams of charged particles known as stellar winds flow outward from the star along magnetic field lines. In the case of the Sun, some of the charged particles that constitute the solar wind reach Earth, where they are deflected by Earth's magnetic field towards Earth's North and South Poles. Where these particles make Earth's atmosphere glow, they produce the aurorae.\n\nThere are a variety of additional astrophysical situations where magnetic fields play important roles, from the ultra-strong magnetic fields of neutron stars or in the vicinity of black holes, to interstellar magnetic fields that influence the large-scale motion of gas and plasma in a galaxy.",

    "Term": "Magnitude",
    "Definition": "In astronomy, the magnitude is a measure of how bright a celestial object is. The magnitude system used in astronomy originated in antiquity as a ranking of stars from the brightest to the least bright. That is why a smaller (or more negative) magnitude value means that the object is brighter, and a larger number means a fainter object. Hence a star with magnitude -1 is brighter than a star with magnitude 0 which in turn is brighter than a star of magnitude 1.\n\nMagnitude has a logarithmic scale, in which a magnitude difference of five corresponds to a factor of 100 difference in the amount of energy received: a star with magnitude 10 is a hundred times dimmer than a star with magnitude 5.\n\nThere are different types of magnitude: apparent magnitude measures the apparent brightness of an object, which depends both on the object's luminosity – how much light the object emits – and on its distance from Earth.\n\nIn contrast, the absolute magnitude is the value we would obtain if the object were at a standard distance of 10 parsecs (32.6 light years) from Earth. (For reflecting objects such as asteroids, there is a different definition.)\n\nIn practice, magnitude is specified for observations through a specific filter, corresponding to an object's brightness in a given wavelength range of light. Numerous \"photometric systems\" for specifying filters, and corresponding magnitudes, exist. In contrast, the bolometric magnitude is a direct measure of the luminosity of an object: the total electromagnetic energy emitted in unit time. Visual magnitudes correspond to the brightness as perceived by the human eye.",

Stars on the main sequence are often referred to as dwarfs to differentiate them from giants. Hot stars on the main sequence are brighter than cool stars on the main sequence.

In everyday speech mass and weight are often used interchangeably but in physics they are not the same. Mass remains the same regardless of location while weight depends on the local gravitational field.\n\nThere are two concepts of mass: \"gravitational mass\" and \"inertial mass\". \"Inertial mass\" is the property of matter that causes it to resist acceleration; it is the mass in Newton's second law. We see that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. Hence the more massive a body the less it accelerates for a given force.\n\n\"Gravitational mass\" is the property of matter that causes it to exert and experience the gravitational force. The more massive a body, the greater force due to gravity it feels.\n\nAlbert Einstein asserted that these two mass concepts are identical via his \"principle of equivalence\". This is a fundamental concept in physics.\n\nThe kilogram (kg) is the internationally recognized unit of mass measurement (other units can be used such as: grams, milligrams, ton, ounce, and pound), and mass is represented by the symbol m. Mass is a scalar quantity and is a form of energy. As such, it can be transformed into other forms of energy, such as during nuclear reactions, and it is not strictly conserved.

    "Term": "Meteorite",
    "Definition": "A meteorite is a solid cosmic body between 30 micrometers and 1 meter in size that falls to the surface of the Earth or another celestial body after passing through that body's atmosphere. An object is only described as a meteorite after it has passed through the Earth or other celestial body's atmosphere. While in interplanetary space and while it is passing through the atmosphere it is known as a meteoroid. The shock wave the meteoroid causes in the atmosphere emits light and may be observed as a meteor.\n\nMeteorites are usually made of stone, iron-stone, or iron, with stone being the most common when we look at types of meteorites that are linked to the sighting of a meteor. However, stony meteorites often look like terrestrial rocks so can be overlooked and iron meteorites are the most common type of meteorite found on the ground. Most meteorites are found in Antarctica or deserts as this is where they are easiest to spot.\n\nMost of the found meteorites range from a few grams to several kilograms in mass. The largest known one is Hoba, which is more than 60 tons and lies in Namibia. Some meteorites can be large enough to produce an impact crater. Meteorites are named after the area where they fell.",

Meteoroids can fall towards any celestial object, with or without an atmosphere, at very high speed. If the celestial body has an atmosphere the meteoroid is slowed down by collisions with atmospheric molecules. We observe meteoroids in Earth's atmosphere as meteors. If the meteoroid is not completely destroyed in the atmosphere (or if the celestial body has no atmosphere) it falls to the surface of that body, and then it is called a meteorite.",

Other materials sometimes used for the mirror body include ceramics and metals. The mirror body is ground (or otherwise shaped) and polished, and if the material is not already reflective, a thin metal coating is applied to the surface. Aluminum is the most common coating material, but gold or silver are alternatives.\n\nFor telescopes larger than about 6 meters in diameter, casting and supporting such huge glass mirrors is difficult. As a result, some of the largest telescopes in the world now use many smaller mirrors that are arranged together to focus light as if they were one giant mirror.",

The Moon is the only major natural satellite of Earth, and ranks fifth among the natural satellites of the Solar System in terms of size and mass. \"Moon\" is capitalized to distinguish it from other natural satellites, or moons, in the Solar System and beyond. Compared with other Solar System moons, the Moon has the largest size relative to the size of the planet it orbits. The Moon follows an elliptical orbit around Earth, at an average distance from Earth of 384,000 kilometers (km). It has no atmosphere and is composed of similar materials to the Earth with an iron-rich core and rocky outer layers. The similarity is no accident: To the best of our knowledge, the Moon formed from the debris of the collision between Earth and a Mars-sized planet around 4.5 billion years ago; most of its material stems from the original Earth's mantle. The surface of the Moon has dark areas known as mare, lighter highlands, and is pockmarked with craters. The surface area of the Moon is 3.79 x 107 square kilometers, its volume is 2.20 x 1010 cubic kilometers, and its mass is 7.35 x 1022 kilograms (kg). The exact value of the Moon's orbital period around Earth depends on the frame of reference: relative to the distant stars, it completes one orbit every 27.3 days (\"sidereal period\").

Most NEOs are Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs).\n\nA NEO is called a Potentially Hazardous Object (PHO) if it has the following properties: For one, it needs to come closer to Earth's orbit than 5% of the Earth–Sun distance (closer than 0.05 astronomical units). In addition such an object needs to have a certain minimum size – otherwise, it would pose no danger to Earth. Size is difficult to measure for smaller objects in the Solar System, so astronomers instead use a minimal value for such an object's absolute brightness – after all, the larger an object is, the brighter it is likely to be. To qualify as a PHO, an object needs to have an absolute magnitude of 22.0 or brighter (using the magnitude system as astronomy's standard way of measuring brightness).

Historically, the term nebulae included any extended fuzzy-looking object, including what we today recognize as galaxies – distant star systems like our own Milky Way galaxy. Today, the term nebula is restricted to gas and dust clouds that are part of the interstellar medium – the gas and dust between stars within a galaxy. The category includes a number of different kinds of object: Molecular clouds are comparatively cold and dark, and predominantly consist of molecular hydrogen; inside clouds like this is where new stars are formed. Giant molecular clouds can contain up to a few millions of solar masses' worth of hydrogen gas. Young stars frequently emit narrow jets of ionized gas; when those jets excite the surrounding gas, the result is a type of nebula called a Herbig–Haro object. When massive stars have formed, their intense radiation makes the surrounding gas emit characteristic reddish light; the results are nebulae of hot and ionized hydrogen gas which are called HII regions. Other types of nebula are associated with the death of stars: low-mass stars leave behind expanding shells of gas that are (somewhat confusingly) called planetary nebulae. When a high-mass star explodes as a supernova, the ejected gas forms a type of nebula called a supernova remnant.",

In the early outer Solar System these chemicals were frozen and accreted onto the young Neptune, hence the name \"ice giant\". Neptune's outer atmosphere is a thick, puffy layer of hydrogen and helium.\n\nIts typical distance from the Sun is about 4.5 billion km, around 30 astronomical units (Earth–Sun distances). Neptune has at least 14 moons and a faint ring system. As the outermost major planet, Neptune's gravity plays a pivotal role in shaping the orbits of smaller bodies in the Kuiper Belt.\n\nNeptune is not visible to the naked eye. It was first identified due to the effect its gravity has on the orbit of Uranus.

Typically neutrinos are detected by observing huge tanks of water (or blocks of ice such as at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole). When a neutrino hits a water molecule in one of these tanks (or in the block of ice), it sets off particle reactions that lead to tiny amounts of light being produced. This light can be detected and analyzed. Neutrinos have been detected from the nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun and from supernovae.

    "Definition": "Newton’s Laws of Motion are a set of models which explain how objects with mass change their motion due to interactions with other objects. These interactions are described as forces. Newton's Laws explain how forces affect the motion of objects. Newton developed three laws of motion and a law of gravitation. These laws can explain the motion of most objects in the Universe, with motions involving high velocities and/or very strong gravity requiring Einstein's theories of special and general relativity respectively.",

    "Term": "Night",
    "Definition": "Night is a period of darkness when the Sun is below the horizon. Night lasts from sunset to sunrise. On most of the Earth, each 24-hour day has one night. However, north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle, there are periods of darkness around the winter solstice where the polar night can last for months. These areas have no night around the time of the summer solstice.\n\nThe period when the Sun is just below the horizon is called twilight. During twilight, the Sun still illuminates part of the sky. Twilight is divided into three equal periods: Civil twilight, nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight. During civil twilight – when the Sun is zero to six degrees below the horizon – the sky is relatively bright so artificial illumination such as street lighting is often not required. Nautical twilight – when the Sun is six to 12 degrees below the horizon – has both bright stars visible and a sky bright enough to see the horizon even on a moonless night. This allows sailors to navigate using celestial navigation. Astronomical twilight is when the Sun is 12 to 18 degrees below the horizon.",

The name derives from the Latin nova stella or new star, which was used in early-Modern Europe to describe bright stars that suddenly appeared in the sky. Novae have been observed as \"guest stars\" by many different cultures.\n\nNovae are caused by white dwarfs which accrete gas from a close binary star companion. This gas builds up in the white dwarf's atmosphere until it is hot enough to ignite through nuclear fusion. This nuclear fireball causes the white dwarf to brighten by several orders of magnitude. Unlike a Type Ia supernova, the white dwarf remains intact after this explosion. This means that the whole process can start again and the nova can recur.",

    "Term": "Nuclear Fusion",
    "Definition": "Nuclear fusion is the process where the atomic nuclei of lighter elements join together to form the nucleus of a heavier element.\n\nIn the Universe, nuclear fusion plays two important roles. For one, it provides the energy supply for the radiation emitted by stars like our Sun. When sufficiently light nuclei fuse, the total rest mass of the resulting nucleus is slightly smaller than the combined rest masses of the initial nuclei. This \"mass deficit\" corresponds to the energy released by the fusion reaction, via Einstein's famous formula E=mc2, which links mass m, energy E, and the speed of light c. For example, in the core of the Sun, hydrogen nuclei fuse together to form helium and release energy in the form of radiation as well as neutrino particles.\n\nThe second role of nuclear fusion is that it is responsible for producing elements in the Universe that are more complex than hydrogen and helium. After the Big Bang, only hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of lithium nuclei existed in the Universe. Fusion reactions in the cores of stars, in the course of supernova explosions, and from explosions caused by colliding neutron stars, are the source of (essentially) all the remaining heavier chemical elements in the Universe. The chemical elements that make up the greatest part of the human body by mass, notably oxygen and carbon, were formed by nuclear fusion in the core of stars or during supernova explosions, prompting the expression \"we are star dust\".",

    "Definition": "All the matter that we see around us consists of atoms, and each atom in turn consists of electrons surrounding a small, central nucleus. Atomic nuclei consist of protons, which are positively charged, and neutrons, which carry no electric charge. Although the protons repel each other due to their electric charge, there is an even stronger force, called the strong nuclear force or just the strong force, that holds the nucleus together. Nuclei with the same number of protons form atoms that belong to the same chemical element.\n\nNuclei are tiny, only about 1/100,000th of the size of an atom – so in a sense, most of the atom is empty space! The nucleus typically accounts for more than 99.9% of an atom's total mass. That mass at such tiny size makes nuclei very dense, with typical densities of a hundred million billion kilograms per cubic meter.\n\nNuclei are important in different areas of astrophysics. In the interior of stars, energy is set free as lighter nuclei (starting with hydrogen, whose nucleus is a single proton) fuse to form successively heavier nuclei – this is what makes stars shine. Nuclear fusion in stars can form heavy nuclei up to those of iron, with supernova explosions and the interior of certain cool stars able to form even heavier nuclei. Shortly after the Big Bang, a brief phase of \"Big Bang nucleosynthesis\" had hydrogen nuclei fusing to helium and traces of other elements. Neutron stars, as the remnants of the supernova explosions of massive stars, consist of mostly neutrons stacked to similar densities as those of nuclei. Certain types of atomic nuclei, stripped of their electrons, are emitted by stars as part of stellar winds, or travel the depths of space as cosmic rays.",

In addition, the Earth's atmosphere is transparent not only for visible light, but for the directly adjacent infrared and ultraviolet regions, allowing all three kinds of observations from the ground. Last but not least, the camera chips astronomers use for visible-light observations can also detect near-infrared and ultraviolet light. Put all of this together, and the telescopes and instruments astronomers use to observe visible light work just as well for near-infrared and ultraviolet observations. In consequence, it makes sense for astronomers to collectively describe observations in that range of the electromagnetic spectrum with a single term, namely optical astronomy.

This makes them physically distinct from the inner planets, each of which is a comparatively small rocky body with a comparatively thin atmosphere.\n\nPlanets around stars other than our Sun do not necessarily fall into inner and outer groups with similar characteristics – we know a number of stars with at least one gas giant, a \"hot Jupiter\", in close orbit.",

Its proportion in the atmosphere is small, and in some areas it may not exceed one part in a million. Depending on where the ozone is, it can protect or harm life on Earth.\n\nMost of the ozone is located in the stratosphere, where it acts as a shield that protects Earth's surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This armor has weakened due to human introduction of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere, thus increasing the risk of skin cancer, cataracts, and weakened immune systems. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol banned use of these gases as refrigerants and aerosol spray propellants with the result that the stratospheric ozone layer has begun to recover.\n\nNear Earth's surface and within the troposphere, ozone is a very harmful pollutant and can cause damage to lung tissue and plants.",

    "Term": "Parallax",
    "Definition": "Parallax is the apparent change in position of a celestial object on the sky due to a change in the observer’s point of view. The position change in the sky, expressed as an angle, is determined relative to the most distant objects we know – historically, distant stars; in modern astronomy, extremely distant objects called quasars, which determine what is called the International Celestial Reference Frame. The angle of apparent position change is inversely proportional to the object's distance from us, making parallax measurements a powerful tool for determining distances in our cosmic neighborhood (\"parallax method\"). For Solar System objects, simultaneous observations from different locations on Earth can yield useful parallax values. For stars, parallax angles are given for a standard shift of observer position by one astronomical unit (the average Earth–Sun distance) at right angles to the line of sight. Observer position shifts of that magnitude can be achieved by making observations several months apart, with Earth moving along its orbit around the Sun in between. By definition, an object whose parallax angle under those conditions is 1 arcsecond is at a distance of 1 parsec (3.26 light years) from Earth. Over one year, the apparent position of a star in the sky traces out an ellipse, whose semi-major axis is the parallax angle. The most accurate stellar parallaxes to date are supplied by ESA's Gaia mission, a space telescope specifically designed for that task.",

    "Term": "Parsec",
    "Definition": "The parsec (pc) is a standard unit of distance measure in astronomy, defined as follows: Imagine a circle with a radius of one astronomical unit (which is the average Earth–Sun distance), which we are viewing face-on. From a distance of exactly one parsec, we will see the circle's radius subtend an angle of one arcsecond. This makes 1 pc equal to approximately 3.26 light years, and to as many astronomical units as there are arcseconds in one radian: 206,264.8 astronomical units. The practical importance of this definition is its relation to the parallax method of distance determination. For this method, one measures tiny position shifts of astronomical objects in the sky as the observer position changes by a given length. For an astronomical object at a distance of one parsec, a change in observer position by one astronomical unit (usually because the Earth has moved along its orbit between the two observations) corresponds to an apparent position shift, called the object's parallax (angle), of one arcsecond. This results in a simple relationship: The distance in parsecs is one divided by the parallax angle in arcseconds. Its direct geometrical meaning makes the parsec the professional astronomer's preferred measure of distance, more common in the literature than distances given in light years. Sirius is 2.7 pc distant from us, corresponding to a parallax of 1/2.7=0.37 arcseconds. Even Proxima Centauri, the closest star apart from our Sun, has a parallax of less than 1 arcsecond.",

For astronomy, the most important matter particles are the electron as well as the quarks, up quark and down quark, that make up the composite particles proton and neutron. Atomic matter consists of protons and neutrons forming the atomic nucleus, surrounded by electrons.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation, as the main astronomical messenger, consists of quantum particles called photons. At lower photon energies, the wave properties of these quantum particles are most important. Radio astronomers, for instance, describe the electromagnetic radiation they receive not in terms of separate particles, but as electromagnetic waves, characterized by wavelength or frequency. On the other end of the electromagnetic spectrum, for the highest-energy photons, the particle properties are the most important. High-energy astronomers who observe using X-rays or gamma rays typically make their observations using particle detectors, and describe the properties of the radiation they receive in terms of particle energies.",

    "Definition": "In astronomy, phase refers to the state of partial illumination of a moon or planet with respect to a specific observer. A distant light source typically illuminates only half of a spherical body's surface; the rest remains dark. Similarly, only about half of a spherical body's surface is within a distant observer's sight. The phase specifies which fraction of the surface within the observer's sight is illuminated. It changes as the relative positions of the object, the observer, and the light source change.\n\nThe best-known examples are the phases of the Moon. The relative positions of the Moon, of the Earth as the location of the observer, and of the Sun as the light source, change as the Moon orbits the Earth over the course of about one month. Hence, over that time, an observer on Earth will see different phases of the Moon. The phase where all of the Moon's surface that is in the observer's sight is illuminated is called \"full Moon\"; when no illuminated surface regions are visible, we have \"new Moon\". The two half-illuminated phases are called \"first\" or \"second quarter\", respectively. Less-than-half illumination makes for a \"crescent (Moon)\".\n\nPhases are also seen in planets in the Solar System (particularly prominent for Mercury and Venus), and have been inferred for exoplanet systems. For the Moon, even non-illuminated regions are not completely dark: they reflect light reaching them from Earth, in a phenomenon known as Earthshine, first documented by Leonardo da Vinci.",

It can be explained by considering light as particles or packets of energy called photons. For materials, mostly metals, the frequency of light should be greater than a threshold frequency (characteristic of the material) for the emission of these photoelectrons to occur. Their maximum energy is determined by the frequency; increasing the frequency of the light brings about an increase in the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons. On increasing the intensity of monochromatic light, more electrons are released, but there is no change in their maximum kinetic energy.

    "Definition": "A planetary system is a system where one or more planets orbit one or more stars, brown dwarfs, and/or stellar remnants. Our Solar System is a planetary system with the Sun at its center. Over the past decades, thousands of planetary systems have been discovered around stars other than the Sun. A few cases are known where the central object of a planetary system is a brown dwarf, or a stellar remnant such as a neutron star or white dwarf.\n\nPlanetary systems can also be found around components of multiple star systems, such as the planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun and a member of a triple star system. There are also a handful of circumbinary planets, which orbit both stars of a binary star system.\n\nThe scale of planetary systems varies greatly, with some planets orbiting only a few stellar radii from their host star while others have orbits thousands of astronomical units across (where an astronomical unit corresponds to the average Earth–Sun distance).",

    "Definition": "Plasma is a quasi-neutral (i.e. charge balanced) gas where a significant fraction of the particles are positive ions and negative electrons, often mixed with molecules and neutral atoms. The properties of plasma are so different from those of ordinary neutral gases that plasma is considered a \"fourth state of matter\". The positive ions and negative electrons allow a plasma to conduct electricity. Plasma can form at high temperatures (as in stars) or by photoionization (as in interstellar gas). Plasma is found in stars, the interstellar medium, in the space between the planets in the Solar System in the form of the solar wind, within the planetary magnetosphere, and in the space between galaxies. It is estimated that more than 99% of the ordinary matter in the observable Universe (excluding dark matter and dark energy) is in the plasma state.",

It used to be known as the ninth Solar System planet, but in 2006 it was reclassified as a dwarf planet. It was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh. Pluto's average distance from the Sun is 6 billion kilometers (km), and its radius is 1185 km (smaller than the Earth's moon). One year on Pluto is equivalent to 247.9 Earth years and its day is equivalent to 6.4 Earth days.\n\nNASA's New Horizon mission was the first spacecraft to fly by Pluto, in 2015, and provided the first ever detailed view of its surface and its atmosphere. The surface of Pluto is so cold that very little of the hydrogen can exist in gaseous form. What little atmosphere Pluto has is mainly nitrogen, and the surface has large plains of frozen nitrogen. Its atmosphere extends to a distance of 1600 km. Pluto is composed of rocks (70%) and ice (30%). It has five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.",

During a polar night the Sun is below the horizon for more than 24 hours and this period of darkness can last for months. During a polar day the Sun is above the horizon for more than 24 hours and daytime can last for months. Polar days and nights are longest closer to the poles.

    "Definition": "Polaris is the nearest bright star (within one degree) to the celestial North Pole. Its official designation is α Ursae Minoris, but it is commonly known as Polaris, the North Star, or the Pole Star. All the stars of the northern hemisphere appear to rotate around it, so it provides an excellent fixed point from which to perform measurements for navigation and astrometry. Its elevation above the horizon gives the approximate latitude of the observing site. However, its position on the celestial sphere is slowly changing due to the precession of the rotation axis of Earth, so in several centuries Polaris will not indicate the location of the celestial North Pole anymore.\n\nPolaris is a triple star system, composed of the primary, a yellow supergiant designated Polaris Aa, in orbit with a smaller companion, Polaris Ab, a very close main sequence star; the pair has a wide companion, Polaris B, a main sequence star orbiting at a distance of 2400 astronomical units (the orbital period is about 29.3 years). Polaris B can be resolved with a modest telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope was able to resolve all three members of the Polaris ternary system. The apparent visual magnitude of Polaris fluctuates because Polaris Aa is a Cepheid variable. The Polaris system is about 447 light years from Earth.",

    "Term": "Precession",
    "Definition": "In astronomy precession is the gradual change of the rotational axis or orbital parameters of an object.\n\nThe most significant precession in astronomy is the precession of the Earth's axis. The Earth's slightly non-spherical shape, combined with the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon leads the Earth's rotation axis to trace out a cone over roughly 26,000 years. This leads to gradual changes in the positions of the celestial poles and the celestial coordinate system. The position of the Sun at the equinoxes also changes, with the Sun's positions at the spring and autumn equinox moving through the constellations of the Zodiac over a 26,000-year cycle.\n\nThe orientations of orbits can also precess. Orbits of planets and other objects around the Sun are elliptical. The orientations of these ellipses can change gradually over time. The best-known example is the precession of Mercury's orbit. The closest point of Mercury's orbit around the Sun changes gradually, moving around the Sun very slowly, over a period of over two million years. The rate Mercury's orbit changes in this way is not well-modelled by classical mechanics. The correct modelling of this effect was one of the key tests passed by Einstein's theory of general relativity. Another notable precession is the precession of the Moon's orbit around the Earth.",

    "Definition": "A protostar is an early stage in the star formation process. It is a large mass of gas and dust formed as a result of the contraction of a giant molecular cloud in the interstellar medium. As the cloud collapses, gravitational energy is converted into heat, warming the still-forming protostar. This phase may take anywhere from 105 to 107 years, depending on the mass of the star, with more massive stars forming more quickly. It begins with an increase in density in the molecular cloud core and ends with the formation of a pre-main-sequence star. Pre-main-sequence stars of similar mass to the Sun are known as T-Tauri stars. Once hydrogen fusion ignites in the core of a star it begins producing energy and becomes a main sequence star.",

    "Term": "Radial Velocity",
    "Definition": "When astronomers observe a distant object, the radial velocity is the part of the object's motion along the observer's line of sight – taking the object directly away from or directly towards the observer. Radial velocities are measured using the Doppler effect: For astronomical objects moving towards us, spectral lines are shifted towards smaller wavelengths (blueshift); for objects moving away from us, the lines are shifted towards larger wavelengths (redshift). Radial velocity is always relative to an observer. Precision measurements often give their results in terms of radial motion relative to the center of mass of the Solar System (\"barycentric\"), subtracting the influence of Earth's motion around the Sun. Objects that are orbiting each other have radial velocities that vary over time. The effect is strongest when we happen to see the orbital plane edge-on. In that case, orbital motion will periodically, and by turns, take each of the objects directly away from us and directly towards us. Radial velocity measurements can be used to deduce such orbital motions even when the objects themselves are not separately visible. Since higher masses induce higher velocities, such measurements can be used to estimate the orbiting objects' masses. This has been used to discover binary stars, or exoplanets orbiting stars, and for reconstructing the masses of star clusters and whole galaxies. A systematic analysis of galaxies' distances and radial velocities led to the discovery of cosmic expansion.",

    "Definition": "Energy is released by nuclear fusion reactions in the core of a star, and eventually radiated away into space from the star's photosphere. There are several ways that energy is transported from the star's core to the photosphere. The radiative zone, radiative region, or radiation zone is the region within a star where the energy is transported outwards by means of radiation, with photons repeatedly scattering off nuclei and electrons, losing some energy in the process but also leading to the emission of new thermal-radiation photons. Due to frequent scattering, progress is slow; in our Sun, photons need thousands of years to cross the radiative zone.\n\nIn the Sun the radiative zone lies between the core and the convective zone. In more massive stars the core itself is convective with the radiative zone extending from the convective core to the star's photosphere. Below 0.3 solar masses, stars have no radiative zone at all and are entirely convective.",

    "Term": "Radio Astronomy",
    "Definition": "Radio astronomy is the branch of astronomy concerned with observations of radio waves, a special region in the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere has \"radio windows\": It allows radio waves in certain frequency (or wavelength) ranges to pass nearly unhindered. That fact allows for observations of such radio waves from astronomical objects with ground-based radio telescopes. Typical observing frequencies range from an upper limit of about 300 gigahertz (GHz) down to tens of megahertz (MHz). This corresponds to wavelengths of 1 millimeter (mm) to tens of meters, respectively. By going to particularly suitable dry, high-altitude locations, astronomers can even perform submillimeter observations, down to wavelengths of about 0.3 mm, corresponding to frequencies of up to 1 terahertz (THz). The lower frequency limit at about 10 MHz is due to Earth's so-called ionosphere. That high-altitude region within our atmosphere contains numerous charged particles, which reflect ultra-long radio waves right back into space. Radio astronomy enables us to observe the emission from cold gas in galaxies and the Milky Way, such as atomic hydrogen and molecular gas. In this way, astronomers can study the diffuse interstellar medium, as well as the regions and processes in which stars and planets are born. Radio astronomy also allows for the study of highly energetic objects such as pulsars and active galactic nuclei: In or around objects like those, electrons are accelerated in a strong magnetic field, leading to the emission of radio waves known as synchrotron radiation. Pulsars and the very bright active galactic nuclei known as quasars were discovered using radio astronomy, as was the remnant of our Universe's hot Big Bang phase, the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although radio waves from space were first detected in the 1930s, radio astronomy only became a major branch of observational astronomy after 1950.",

A rainbow occurs because the small droplets of water in the air break up the white sunlight into the color spectrum through a process called dispersion due to refraction; this is similar to how a prism works. In a normal rainbow, light is reflected once within the water droplets as well as being dispersed through refraction.\n\nSometimes, two nested rainbows can be seen, where the colors in the second rainbow are in reverse order. The inner, brighter one is called the primary rainbow while the outer, fainter one is the secondary rainbow. This double rainbow phenomenon is relatively uncommon.

    "Term": "Red Giant",
    "Definition": "A red giant is a star that has a comparatively cool surface, but a diameter typically tens, or sometimes hundreds, times larger than that of a main sequence star like our Sun. The comparatively low temperature gives the surface a reddish appearance, while the large diameter makes the star shine considerably brighter than our Sun. Red giants were originally main sequence stars, that is, Sun-like stars that burn hydrogen to helium in their cores via nuclear fusion. When such a star runs out of hydrogen fuel, it begins to burn helium into heavier elements. At that time, the star expands, its surface cooling down in the process, and with its increased size the star becomes more luminous. The Sun will enter the red giant phase billions of years from now, at which time life on Earth will likely not survive. Examples of red giants are Arcturus in the constellation Boötes and Mira in the constellation Cetus. Red giants are unstable to pulsation (an oscillation where the star repeatedly becomes smaller and larger in turn) and, as they pulsate, can vary in brightness. The star Mira is an extreme example that can vary in brightness by a factor of 1000. In the spectral classification used by astronomers, red giants are mostly of spectral type M, and some are of spectral type K. Red giants are similar to so-called red supergiants, but with a lower mass.",

    "Definition": "A red supergiant is a star that has a comparatively cool surface but a radius typically several hundred or even thousands of times that of a main sequence star like our Sun. The lower temperature gives the surface a reddish appearance, while the large diameter makes the star shine considerably brighter than our Sun.\n\nRed supergiants are formed in the same way as red giants but from precursor stars that are considerably more massive. Both types were originally main sequence stars, that is, stars like our Sun that burn hydrogen to helium in their cores via nuclear fusion (although with masses much higher than the Sun's in the case of red supergiants). When such a star runs out of hydrogen fuel, it begins to burn helium into heavier elements. At that time, the star expands, its surface cooling down in the process, and with its increased size the star becomes more luminous. The remaining lifetimes of red supergiants amount to only a few tens of thousands of years.\n\nExamples of red supergiants are Betelgeuse, in Orion, and Antares, in Scorpius. Like red giants, red supergiants are prone to pulsation and mass loss. Most, possibly all, red supergiants end in a supernova explosion, ejecting much of their gas, with their cores collapsing to form neutron stars or black holes.",

    "Term": "Redshift",
    "Definition": "This term can refer to three different effects: Doppler, cosmological, or gravitational redshift. Doppler redshift is the opposite of blueshift; in the case of redshift, the source emitting the electromagnetic radiation is moving away from the observer, and so the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation is stretched to longer (redder) wavelengths. This is similar to the Doppler effect in the context of sound waves. Cosmological redshift is the result of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a source being stretched to longer wavelengths because of the physical expansion of space, unlike Doppler redshift which is due to relative motion. Gravitational redshift refers to the effect where the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation emitted from a source is stretched to longer wavelengths, or rather the associated photons lose energy as they try to leave a region (gravitational well) where the gravity is stronger.",

Mirror telescopes are often characterized by primary mirror diameter, ranging from 10 centimeters for smaller amateur telescopes to eight meters for the largest solid mirrors used in professional telescopes. Still larger collecting areas can be obtained by combining several mirror segments, which then act in a way similar to that of a larger solid mirror. There are several types of mirror telescopes. For example, in a Newtonian telescope, the light coming from the primary mirror is reflected sideways by a smaller, flat mirror into an eyepiece or a camera. In a Cassegrain telescope, a smaller, convex secondary mirror reflects the light back through an opening in the main mirror.",

Refracting telescopes are still common as amateur telescopes, where a special combination of lenses that correct for unwanted color effects (\"achromatic telescopes\") can produce excellent image quality for visual observing and for astrophotography. In professional astronomy, refracting telescopes were largely displaced by mirror telescopes from the early 1900s onwards. Astronomers wanted ever-larger apertures (lens or mirror diameters), and it is difficult to make refracting telescopes beyond lens sizes of about one meter as a lens is only supported at the rim, leading to the heavy center of the lens sagging under gravity, distorting the lens's shape and optical properties.",

    "Definition": "Refraction is the way that a wave – and, specifically, light – changes direction as it passes from one medium into another. The magnitude and direction of the change depends on the \"indices of refraction\" of the two media, which in turn depend on the speed of light in each medium, a relation that is encoded mathematically in Snell's law of refraction. The way that light passes into a piece of glass can be used to create a lens, which bundles parallel light rays – such as the light of a distant star – falling onto the lens. This is the main effect used in constructing refracting telescopes. Refraction also depends on the wavelength of the infalling light, a fact that can be used as in a prism, to separate light by wavelength into its constituent elementary colors – which is important for documenting and examining spectra.",

Some of that structure comes about through interaction with Saturn's larger moons, and two gaps are opened up by tiny moons orbiting inside them. There are several hypotheses about how the rings formed, most of them involving a moon torn apart or stripped through Saturn's gravity.

    "Definition": "Tidal forces stretch astronomical objects into elongated shapes. For example, the Moon stretches the water around the Earth into two bulges; this causes the tides on the Earth.\n\nAny two massive objects exert tidal forces on each other. More massive objects exert larger tidal forces while tidal forces are stronger for objects that are closer together. These tidal forces can become so strong that the stretching can rip one of the objects to shreds.\n\nFor an object (e.g. an asteroid or moon) of a particular mass and size close to another massive object there is a distance within which it will be torn to pieces by the other object's tidal forces. This distance is known as the \"Roche limit\".\n\nA common example of the Roche limit is rocky and icy moons orbiting giant planets. If a moon is closer to the giant planet than the Roche limit then it will disintegrate, forming a ring of material around the giant planet.\n\nChains of craters called \"catenae\" visible on the Moon and other rocky bodies in the Solar System are evidence for incoming asteroids breaking up as they pass the Roche limit, leading them to impact as a string of smaller objects, rather than one large body.",

When such a stream is pointed in a specific direction the rocket engine is accelerated in the opposite direction – a consequence of a fundamental law of physics called momentum conservation.

Northern hemisphere seasons are opposite to southern seasons: Northern summer when the northern hemisphere is tilted maximally towards the Sun, is southern winter, with the southern hemisphere tilted away, and vice versa for southern summer. Many parts of the Earth close to the equator have seasons that are different from the summer and winter pattern seen at temperate and arctic latitudes. It should be noted that the duration, beginning, and end of each season can be influenced by cultural practices and time period.",

    "Definition": "A shooting star (or meteor) is a fragment of an asteroid or comet, or a piece of space debris, entering the atmosphere of the Earth or another celestial body and catching fire due to heat generated by friction with the atmosphere. This heat generated by friction is similar to the way we warm our hands by rubbing them together when we are cold. Shooting stars are usually very small in size ranging from a few millimeters to a few centimeters. Astronomers call them meteors. Their direction, time of year we observe them, and color allow us to learn more about where they originated from and what they are made of.\n\nThe brightest meteors are called fireballs and they can often be seen in the sky, sometimes even during the day. Occasionally, observers have even reported hearing sounds as they burn and travel through the atmosphere. Shooting stars also causes the ionization of the atmosphere which, for Earth, can be observed with radar.\n\nOn Earth, shooting stars are visible throughout the year, but occasionally many shooting stars occur in short timescales such as on the same night. Many of these meteor showers recur on predictable yearly patterns and have been given names based on the constellation the meteors appear to originate (or radiate) from. Famous meteor showers include the Perseids and the Leonids.",

    "Term": "Sidereal Time",
    "Definition": "Sidereal time is a measure of time based on the Earth's rotation relative to distant stars in the night sky. At night, we can see the pattern of stars in the night sky rotate around us. If we pick a star and note when it reaches its highest position in the sky, then exactly one sidereal day later, namely 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds later as measured by our clocks, the star will again reach that highest position.\n\nThis is subtly different from a solar day, which is the time between local noon – defined as when the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky – on two consecutive days. The reason is that the Earth orbits the Sun. For an observer on the Earth, this introduces additional changes of the Sun's position in the sky over the course of one year. During the time it takes for the Earth to rotate once with respect to the distant stars, the Sun has moved and the Earth needs to rotate a little bit more to catch up. That is why a solar day is a little bit longer than a sidereal day.\n\nSidereal time is important for astronomers as it tells them which parts of the sky are overhead at a particular point during the day or night, and thus which objects can be observed. In a standard astronomical coordinate system, the equatorial system, the sidereal time at any place on Earth (excluding the poles) is an angle, namely the right ascension (one of the coordinates used to specify locations in the sky in that system) of the point in the sky directly overhead. In practice, when observing, present-day astronomers make use of the time measured by highly precise atomic clocks, and then use computers to calculate which clock time corresponds to which sidereal time.",

Examples are decommissioned or faulty satellites, broken pieces resulting from the collision of satellites, or upper stages of rockets that were used in the launch of spacecraft or satellites and discarded after having fulfilled their purpose. The more space debris there is, the greater the chance of damaging collisions as a serious hazard for spacecraft. In consequence, space agencies are discussing, and have begun to test, ways of removing space debris, and are making an effort to plan missions so that objects that have fulfilled their purpose are made to re-enter, and burn up in, Earth's atmosphere.",

Specifically, it provides suitable living conditions, from breathable air to well-regulated temperature. All space stations so far have been dependent on regular deliveries of food and water. So far, space stations are or have been in low Earth orbits, with the International Space Station orbiting around 420 kilometers above sea level. An orbiting station is in free fall, with the astronauts, equipment, and space station all experiencing the same acceleration from the Earth's gravity. As the astronauts and equipment inside the space station are accelerating at the same magnitude and direction as their surroundings in the space station they experience the sensation of weightlessness, even though they are not actually weightless. This sensation is often called microgravity, although this name can be confusing as the Earth's gravitational pull is still substantial on the space station, astronauts, and equipment. Space stations are primarily used for research, notably on the effect of microgravity on human beings; an important preparation for further stages of space exploration.",

This sequence has recently been extended to the cooler types L, T, and Y. These three represent mostly brown dwarfs, but some objects with spectral type L are stars rather than brown dwarfs.\n\nThere are also letters to classify special classes of star. Carbon stars are stars with strong spectral features from molecules containing carbon. These are classified as type C. S-type stars are intermediate between types K or M and C in that the surface abundances of oxygen and carbon are nearly equal. White dwarfs are divided into a series of different types based on features in their spectra; all these types begin with the letter D (DA, DB, etc.). Hot, massive stars with broad emission lines have a series of types beginning with W (WN, WC, WO).\n\nThe present notation is a legacy from the first modern classification attempt, undertaken at Harvard College Observatory. The classes, originally designated A–Q, alphabetically, were subsequently reordered as a temperature sequence, resulting in the main types still used today. The main spectral classes are subdivided, denoted by the numbers from zero to nine. The Sun is spectral type G2.

    "Definition": "A rainbow forms when water droplets split light into elementary colors, from violet, blue, and green, to yellow, orange, and red. Each color corresponds to a range of wavelengths, and the rainbow colors are arranged in order of increasing wavelength from violet to red. This kind of decomposed light, or electromagnetic radiation in general, into different wavelengths is called a spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is a mixture of light particles called \"photons\". Creating a spectrum amounts to sorting photons by energy and documenting how many photons there are in each given energy range. By a basic law of quantum mechanics, this is equivalent to sorting light by frequency – yet another way of documenting a spectrum.\n\nIf the amount of energy varies smoothly with wavelength (or photon energy, or frequency), the spectrum is called continuous. In contrast, sharp dips or peaks in a spectrum at certain wavelengths are called absorption and emission lines, respectively. Such lines arise due to transitions between different energy levels within atoms or molecules (or even atomic nuclei), either absorbing or emitting radiation at specific wavelengths. For example, in visible light, stars show continuous spectra with absorption lines. The lines carry information about a star's chemical composition. The analysis of spectra is known as spectroscopy; instruments that allow for the recording of spectra are called spectroscopes, spectrometers, or spectrographs.",

Standard candles have luminosities that can be estimated without knowing their distance. The standard candle's distance can then be calculated by comparing that luminosity and the object's apparent brightness in the night sky. Important examples include Cepheid variables (pulsating stars where there is a relation between the pulsation period and the luminosity), and Type Ia supernovae (bright stellar explosions where there is a relation between the maximum luminosity and the timescale on which the brightness decreases directly afterwards).",

Such stellar remnants are not simply plasma balls – a white dwarf can crystallize into an unusual kind of solid after cooling down for billions of years, and neutron stars bear a close similarity to gigantic atomic nuclei.\n\nWhether viewed with the naked eye or with visible-light telescopes, stars are the most obvious objects in the night sky.

    "Term": "Stellar Evolution",
    "Definition": "Stellar evolution describes the aging of stars and how they change over their life cycle. Unlike in evolutionary biology, stellar evolution does not refer to changes in traits between different generations of stars.\n\nStars spend most of their life on the main sequence stage of stellar evolution, fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores and releasing energy. As a star ages and starts to run out of hydrogen in its core, the core will contract and may become hot enough to start helium fusion. Depending on the mass of the star, this can lead to the star evolving into a giant or supergiant. In some giants and supergiants, fusion produces heavier and heavier elements.\n\nStars with initial masses between a half and eight times the mass of our Sun will end up with cores of carbon, oxygen, and/or neon, while hydrogen and helium fusion continues in shells around the core, providing them with a layered onion-like structure. They will eventually lose their outer layers, which go on to form a planetary nebula, leaving only the core as a small, bright white dwarf.\n\nStars weighing more than eight solar masses continue fusing heavier elements until the nuclei in their core have fused to iron. Further fusion then can liberate no additional energy. This triggers a supernova explosion, which leaves behind either a very compact neutron star or, for very massive stars, a black hole.\n\nBoth planetary nebulae and supernova explosions eject matter from stars into the interstellar medium. At certain other phases of their evolution, many stars also eject mass by stellar winds, extreme pulsations, or explosions.

This changes how light and heat travel through their interiors and atmospheres, making them smaller, hotter, and fainter.\n\nIn the region of the Milky Way near the Solar System, subdwarfs are members of either the galactic halo or the older part of the galactic disk and were formed at an early stage of the Milky Way. This is because each generation of stars produces more metals through nuclear fusion, returning a portion of these to the interstellar medium, the gas reservoir from which stars form. As a result younger stars have more metals than older stars. Hence subdwarfs, which have fewer metals, are typically older stars.\n\nThere are also a small number of hot subdwarfs of spectral types O and B (known as sdO and sdB stars). Astronomers are not sure how these objects form but one possible reason is giant stars losing their outer layers for some reason. What causes the loss of these outer layers is uncertain but one possible reason is a giant star having its outer layers stripped off by a binary star companion.",

It is particularly useful for studying dusty star-forming regions and planet-forming disks around young stars. On larger scales, it can be used to study the contribution of dust to the overall emission of galaxies.\n\nMany of the astronomical techniques for submillimeter astronomy are shared with radio astronomy, and many submillimeter observatories use arrays of telescopes that are connected so as to achieve a level of detail that would otherwise only be available to a much larger telescope dish. There are, however, single dish observatories as well. Submillimeter observatories are typically located in very dry places, in order to reduce atmospheric absorption from water vapor that would otherwise block the submillimeter radiation reaching us from outer space. Commonly, these locations are at high altitudes, such as Mauna Kea on Hawaii, the Chajnantor plateau in Chile, or at Hanle in the Indian part of the Himalaya mountain range, but there are also submillimeter telescopes in Antarctica.

This means the Sun is a main sequence star with a typical temperature (\"effective temperature\") of 5800 kelvins (K). Main sequence stars are stable, with energy released by hydrogen fusion in their core balancing the inwards force due to gravity. The Sun appears white to the human eye as it emits lots of light all across the visible spectrum. When lower in the sky, increased atmospheric extinction can make the Sun appear yellow or orange, hence its common depiction as yellow. Stars range from more than 1000 times brighter than the Sun to some 1000 times fainter, but the brighter ones are relatively rare: the Sun is brighter (and heavier) than most (perhaps some 85%) of the stars in the Galaxy.\n\nFor astronomers, the Sun is interesting because of its proximity, which means that the surface can be resolved in greater detail, allowing structures and phenomena to be studied. For example, detailed studies of solar activity, which is related to the Sun's magnetic fields, can include: sunspots (cooler areas), flares (short-lived bright flashes), and even coronal mass ejections (electrically charged particles flung away from the Sun). Physicists have also detected elementary particles known as neutrinos from the Sun's core; this is direct evidence for nuclear fusion processes. The element helium was first detected in the solar spectrum, hence the name helium, which comes from Helios (in Greek mythology the Sun god).",

Each day, the path traces out an arc, starting with sunrise in the eastern part of the sky and ending with sunset in the western part. Only at the spring and autumn equinoxes does the Sun rise exactly due east and set exactly due west. At the winter solstice, the arc is shortest and lowest in the sky. From then on, the length of that arc, and with it the length of the day, increases, and each successive arc is higher in the sky than the day before, reaching maximum height, and maximum day length, at the summer solstice. This process then repeats in the opposite order, again reaching the shortest, lowest arc at winter solstice.\n\nNorth of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle the Sun does not rise for extended periods in winter or set for extended periods in summer. Hence, they can have nights that last several months in the winter and days that last several months in the summer. During one of these polar days the Sun travels around the sky in a circle, moving from a high point at midday to a low point at midnight without ever crossing the horizon.\n\nThe set of solar arcs can be captured in a long-term exposure image called a solargraph.",

In many supernova remnants the black hole or neutron star created from the star that exploded in the supernova is also present although in some this has been ejected by the force of the explosion.\n\nThe explosive energy of a supernova results in a shockwave that impacts on the surrounding interstellar gas. This shock heats and ionizes the surrounding gas to extremely high temperatures (over a million kelvins). This hot gas emits light across various wavelengths, including being a significant source of X-rays. The shock also accelerates particles to high velocities, making supernova remnants a significant source of cosmic rays.\n\nBy looking at how fast a supernova remnant is expanding, astronomers can estimate how long it would take to reach its current size.

Hence, from our point of view here on Earth, we can regularly find the planets, and also the Sun, in this constellation – in the case of the Sun from May 14 to June 21. (Of course if the Sun is there, we cannot see the constellation's stars.) Taurus is one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union, and also one of the 48 classical constellations named by 2nd century astronomer Claudius Ptolemy. In the northern hemisphere, it's prominently visible in the night sky in winter. Its brightest star is the reddish Aldebaran.",

    "Term": "Telescope",
    "Definition": "A telescope is a device that collects photons (of visible light or other wavelengths) from distant objects and provides information (e.g. an image) about them to an observer. Early telescopes (from the beginning of the 17th century) used lenses as optical elements (see refracting telescope). Lenses are limited in how large they can be made, so in order to see fainter objects in greater detail with larger telescopes, mirrors (see reflecting telescope) were instead used to focus the light. The largest optical telescopes are reflecting telescopes. In the 20th century, telescopes for studying other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum were invented, so there now exist radio telescopes, infrared telescopes, X-ray telescopes, etc. Because celestial sources are faint, astronomers tend to build large aperture telescopes to collect more light and reach finer angular resolutions.",

The latter is predominantly used for scientific purposes. The lowest theoretical temperature is absolute zero (0 K = -273.15 °C), at which no more thermal energy can be extracted from a body.

    "Term": "Theory of General Relativity",
    "Definition": "(The theory of) general relativity, published in 1915, is Albert Einstein's theory linking space, time, and gravity. In that theory, gravity is not an ordinary force. Instead, a mass or other source of gravity will distort space and time in its vicinity. This distortion changes how bodies in free fall move. For instance, when a planet orbits the Sun, it's not because of an attractive force – it's because the planet is taking the straightest possible path through space and time (or more precisely: through \"spacetime\", since in Einstein's theory, there is no unique way of separating space from time). The core equations of general relativity, known as Einstein's equations, provide a direct link between spacetime geometry and the mass and similar properties of the matter contained in that spacetime (specifically the energy density or, equivalently, the mass density, and also pressure). Paraphrasing John Wheeler, by these equations, matter tells spacetime how to curve, while spacetime tells matter how to move. Einstein's theory predicts corrections to the orbits of astronomical objects, which can be observed both in the Solar System – most prominently in the orbit of Mercury – and much more clearly in binary neutron stars, where two very compact objects orbit each other. Its predictions for the influence of gravity on clocks play a role in satellite navigation systems. The theory also predicts new phenomena, which have become an integral part of astrophysics: the deflection of light by mass, observable as the so-called gravitational lensing effect; black holes as the ultra-compact end states of certain stars and central ingredients of galaxies, and gravitational waves as a way of gaining information about, among other things, merging black holes. General relativity is also at the foundation of the cosmological models for expanding universes.",

    "Term": "Thermal Radiation",
    "Definition": "All objects emit electromagnetic radiation in a way directly related to their temperature. This radiation is called thermal radiation. For high enough temperature, some of the thermal radiation is visible to the naked eye, e.g.: a hot stove-top, a heating element, or a poker in the fire, glowing red; molten metal glowing yellow-white; the blueish-white glow during certain welding processes, so bright welders require eye protection. For cooler objects, we do not see the glow, but these objects emit thermal radiation in the infrared range or as radio waves.\n\nThe simplest form of thermal radiation is \"blackbody radiation\": Thermal radiation emitted by an ideal object that absorbs all incoming radiation, regardless of wavelength. The spectrum of that radiation (the information about how the radiation energy is distributed between the different wavelengths) is governed by a mathematical function called the Planck curve, which only depends on the object's temperature. The Planck curve also specifies that the total energy output of thermal radiation steeply increases with temperature.\n\nThe radiation we receive from stars is thermal radiation that closely follows the Planck curve. This, in turn, makes it possible to assign an \"effective temperature\" to each star. The Sun, with a temperature of 5500 degrees Celsius (5780 kelvins) shines in a range of colors that add up to what we define as white. Stars with a lower effective temperature appear reddish, such as red giants or red dwarfs. Hotter stars appear blueish and are typically very bright. At temperatures of tens of thousands or even millions of degrees, most thermal radiation is emitted in the ultraviolet, X-ray, or even gamma ray regions.\n\nThermal radiation is related to the concept of thermal equilibrium. Objects are in thermal equilibrium if they have the same temperature. Thermal radiation is a consequence of objects striving towards thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic fields permeating all of space.",

    "Term": "Tidal Locking",
    "Definition": "Tidal locking is a process where tidal forces alter the rotation of one body orbiting another, changing its rotation period. A good example of this is the Moon. The Moon is subtly stretched by tidal forces from Earth's gravity, changing its shape so it is subtly elongated with the long axis pointing towards the Earth. As it orbits the Earth, the Earth exerts a subtle force on this tidal bulge. If the Moon were to rotate so that its elongated axis no longer faced the Earth, the tidal force would drag the Moon back so that its tidal bulge would again point towards the Earth. This means that the Moon always presents the same face toward the Earth as tidal locking has made its rotation period equal to its orbital period.\n\nThis one-to-one relationship between period and orbit is not always true for tidally locked bodies. Mercury's relatively elliptical orbit around the Sun, combined with tidal locking, means that Mercury rotates three times every time it completes two orbits of the Sun.",

Earth's ocean water follows those tidal accelerations, forming \"tidal bulges\" directly under the Moon and on the opposite side, which produces Earth's tides.",

    "Term": "Time",
    "Definition": "All of us have a basic idea of what time is: A progression of events, one after the other, from the past through the present to the future. Yet time is not something that can be seen, heard, smelled, touched, or tasted. It can be measured, though, and that is the aspect of time that matters in astronomy and in physics.\n\nWe measure time by comparing the duration of whatever is happening with the duration measured on a clock or, for longer periods of time, on a calendar. Traditionally, measurements of time of this kind have been based on the Earth's rotation. The time it takes the Earth to complete one full rotation (as judged by the position of the Sun) defines the length of one day. The usual subdivisions – one day divided into 24 hours, each hour divided into 60 minutes, each minute into 60 seconds – provide additional units of time.\n\nSince 1967, the definition of time has instead been based on the duration of a second, as measured by a Caesium-133 atomic clock (\"SI second\"). Several systems of time are defined on this basis, notably Universal Time (UTC) which is used in official time-keeping world-wide, and what is known as the Julian Date and its variations, a continuous counting of days used in astronomy.\n\nEinstein's special theory of relativity and his general theory of relativity have shown that the time that passes on a clock depends both on the motion and on the influence of gravity of that clock. These relativistic effects need to be accounted for in highly accurate measurements of time, such as the ones using the satellites of the Global Positioning System (GPS).",

Local noon strongly depends on longitude: An observer located eastward of another observer will see the Sun rise, and reach noon, earlier. All locations at the same longitude have the same moment of local noon, so in principle, we could define a common measure of time for all those locations. In practice, a common time is defined for a segment of longitude or for a country or a region of a country. For most locations, local noon will be close to, but slightly before or after the time zone's official noon. In this scheme, differences in official time almost always amount to an integer number of hours (although some defined time zones deviate from this scheme by, say, half an hour).",

For a solar eclipse, for instance, any observer in the umbra will see the Sun's disk covered completely by the disk of the Moon. An observer located in the penumbra region, on the other hand, will only see a partial eclipse – in the case of a solar eclipse, the Sun's disk covered only partially by the Moon. If an observer sees the covering object as too small to cover the object behind it completely, as in an annular solar eclipse, the observer is said to be in the antumbra. Alternate meaning: the inner, darker region of a sunspot is called its umbra, the surrounding less dark region its penumbra.",

Uranus has a mass of 14.5 times the Earth's mass, and a solid rock core surrounded by a layer of high-pressure water, methane, and ammonia. In the early outer Solar System these chemicals were frozen. The young Uranus accreted these \"ices\", hence the name \"ice giant\". Uranus's outer atmosphere is a thick, puffy layer of hydrogen and helium. Its rotational axis is tilted by more than 90 degrees relative to the orbital plane. Uranus has a ring system.\n\nIts typical distance from the Sun is about 2.9 billion km, around 19 astronomical units (Earth–Sun distances). Uranus takes around 84 years to complete one orbit. It has over 25 known moons or natural satellites.\n\nUranus is barely visible to the naked eye under good conditions and as a result it was not identified as a planet before the modern era. It was identified as such in 1781 by William Herschel. Thus, it was the first planet to be found since antiquity. Uranus is named after the Greek god of the sky.",

The brightness of all stars changes over millions or billions of years due to stellar evolution. The term variable star is typically reserved for stars whose brightness varies on timescales much shorter than their evolutionary timescales.\n\nThere are several possible physical mechanisms that can lead to variability. Some stars, such as Cepheid variables or RR Lyrae stars, are unstable and pulsate, changing their size and brightness.\n\nOther stars can eject bright material that increases the overall observed brightness (\"eruptive variables\"). Stars called cataclysmic variables or novae show a sudden increase in brightness followed by a return to their previous level. In such systems, the scenario involves a pair of stars, with matter from one flowing onto the other, and igniting in a nuclear fusion reaction as soon as a certain threshold is reached. One companion or the other undergoes the cataclysmic explosion and brightening.\n\nOther stars appear variable because they are rotating, showing us alternately a brighter and a less bright side, or because there are really two stars orbiting each other, with one star periodically being eclipsed behind its companion. This latter class of binary is known as an eclipsing binary.",

    "Definition": "Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun. Often called the Earth's twin it is a rocky, terrestrial planet with a radius a little greater than 6000 kilometers (km), about 95% of the Earth's radius. It has a mass of 0.815 times the mass of the Earth. The atmosphere of Venus is 90 times denser than Earth’s. It is mainly composed of carbon dioxide, together with thick clouds of sulfuric acid that shroud the entire surface. The thick atmosphere produces a very strong greenhouse effect, which results in a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius.\n\nIts typical distance from the Sun is 108 million kilometers, about 0.72 astronomical units (Earth–Sun distances). It takes 224.7 days to complete one orbit. Venus takes a long time to rotate once along its axis with respect to the distant stars; one such Venus day corresponds to 243 Earth days. This is longer than the time it takes Venus to complete one orbit around the Sun. Venus has no known moons.\n\nVenus is named after the Roman goddess of love. Since Venus is so close to the Sun, it is often visible in the night sky shortly before sunrise or after sunset. On these occasions, Venus is conspicuously bright even when seen with the naked eye, and is traditionally referred to as the morning star or evening star, respectively. With binoculars, Venus can be seen to have phases similar to those of the Moon.",

A white dwarf is no longer producing energy from nuclear reactions in its core, but shines due to its leftover energy. The hotter ones appear blue or white because of the energy they radiate due to the very high temperatures on their surfaces. The core of a white dwarf could be made up of helium or carbon–oxygen or oxygen–neon–magnesium depending on the initial mass of the star. It does not contract under self-gravity due to resistance within its interior from electron degeneracy pressure – a quantum phenomenon. Degeneracy pressure can only support white dwarfs with masses up to 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

The energies of the resulting photons (light particles) are in the range between about 100 eV and 100 keV, using the unit \"electron volt\" that is common in particle physics.\n\nIn astronomy, significant X-ray emission typically reaches us from regions containing gas or plasma at very high temperatures, higher than a million kelvins. Examples include the corona of our Sun and the coronae of other stars, and also the accretion disks around compact objects: gas falling towards a neutron star or black hole, and swirling around in an extremely hot disk before falling onto or into the central object. Supernova remnants are another common class of astronomical X-ray source: when a massive star explodes as a supernova at the end of its life, the star's outer layers are flung into space. Where that flung-out gas encounters the surrounding interstellar medium, shock effects will heat up matter in the collision region to high temperatures, resulting in the production of X-rays.",

    "Term": "X-ray Astronomy",
    "Definition": "X-ray astronomy is a field of study dedicated to collecting and analyzing all the information that comes from the cosmos in very energetic electromagnetic radiation (more energetic than ultraviolet radiation but less energetic than gamma radiation). X-rays have frequencies between 30 petahertz and 30 exahertz, which corresponds to wavelengths between 10 picometers and 10 nanometers. In the older unit of length still in use in many areas of astronomy, including X-ray astronomy, this corresponds to between 0.1 and 100 angstroms (Å). Given the prominence of the particle nature of light in that part of the spectrum, X-ray astronomers commonly use photon energies instead of wavelength to characterize what they measure. In terms of electron volts (eV), the energy measure common in particle physics, the above frequency and wavelength ranges correspond to photon energies between 100 eV and 100 keV. As the atmosphere absorbs most X-rays, X-ray astronomy is typically done by space telescopes. X-rays from astronomical sources come from extremely hot regions. These include the disks around compact objects such as black holes or neutron stars, and the hot corona of stars.",

    "Term": "X-ray Telescope",
    "Definition": "An X-ray telescope is a type of telescope specially designed for the observation of high-energy, high-frequency, X-ray light that is invisible to the human eye. Since Earth's atmosphere completely absorbs incoming X-rays, X-ray telescopes are typically space telescopes. The high frequencies and correspondingly short wavelengths of X-rays require optics markedly different from those of visible-light telescopes: X-rays fall onto the telescope mirrors at very shallow angles (\"grazing incidence\") to bounce off the exterior of the mirror (\"external reflection\"). Mirror assemblies for focusing X-rays that work in this way are often built as concentric shells. At very high energies, for \"hard\" X-rays, telescope optics typically do not attempt to focus the light at all, but instead rely on masks to extract information about X-ray direction, and from this information reconstruct images.",

    "Term": "Year",
    "Definition": "A year is the time it takes Earth to go once around the Sun, but there are several definitions for what \"once around\" means. The time it takes for the Sun to appear in the exact same place in the sky from one year to the next is one tropical year, also called the solar year, which amounts to about 365.24 days. The time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit, using the distant stars as a reference, is one sidereal year. The difference between the two, which amounts to about 20 minutes (with the sidereal year the slightly longer) is due to the precession of Earth's axis of rotation – the fact that the axis of Earth's rotation very slowly changes its orientation in space. There is also the anomalistic year: On its elliptic orbit, Earth is sometimes closer, sometimes farther away from the Sun. The anomalistic year is the time between two subsequent closest approaches (\"perihelion passages\") of the Sun. For other planets, within or outside the Solar System, their \"year\" is defined analogously, with respect to these planets' orbits around the Sun or around another central star.",

    "Term": "Zenith",
    "Definition": "The zenith is defined as the point directly above the observer. This makes the zenith an entity that is defined relative to the position of the observer, and the zenith for a person in, say, London would be different from that of a person in Beijing or Cape Town. Measured in angles, the zenith is 90 degrees from the observer's horizon. The zenith angle is the angular distance between a celestial object and the zenith. An object located at the zenith has a zenith angle of 0 degrees, and one on the horizon has a zenith angle of 90 degrees. The opposite of the zenith, namely the point straight below the observer, is called the observer's nadir. If Earth were a perfect sphere, the line linking an observer's zenith and nadir would pass through the center of the Earth, but as, in reality, the Earth is only approximately spherical, Earth's center is usually at some distance from that line.",

    "Term": "Zodiacal Light",
    "Definition": "Within the Solar System, planets and other bodies mostly orbit within the plane of the ecliptic. Interplanetary dust in our cosmic neighborhood is also concentrated near that plane. Some light from the Sun is reflected by those interplanetary dust grains in the ecliptic towards Earth. In principle, that produces a faint glowing ribbon across the night sky, along the Zodiac – the region in the night sky close to the ecliptic. In practice, that glow is only visible with the naked eye to the east shortly before sunrise or to the west shortly after sunset, only close to the horizon, and only from a naturally dark observing location. That visible part of the glow is the zodiacal light: a diffuse glowing region shaped like a rounded, elongated triangle that reaches from the horizon a short way along the ecliptic.",
