    "Term": "A-type Star",
    "Definition": "A star with spectral type \"A\". Astronomers identify A-type stars by the presence of strong absorption lines from hydrogen in their spectra. They have typical (effective) temperatures between around 7400 kelvins (K) and 10,000 K. Compared to other stars, they appear white or bluish white to human eyes unless affected by interstellar or atmospheric reddening. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, and Vega, the star against which all other stars' brightnesses are measured in the apparent magnitude scale, are A-type stars.",

    "Definition": "Absolute magnitude is a measure with two different definitions. Both relate to how bright objects appear under a special set of conditions. This allows the intrinsic properties of objects at different distances to be compared. This is in contrast to apparent magnitude which is a measure of how bright an object appears from the location of the observer.\n\nFor objects outside the Solar System such as stars and galaxies, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object would have when viewed from a standard distance of 10 parsecs, ignoring the effects of interstellar extinction. This standardized number allows different objects to be compared by how intrinsically bright they are.\n\nWithin the Solar System, absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude an object such as an asteroid would have if viewed at a distance of one astronomical unit from the observer, while the object is at a distance of one astronomical unit away from the Sun, and at opposition. Note that an object in the Solar System can never match these conditions when viewed from Earth but the definition removes factors that depend on the locations of the object and the observer to allow Solar System objects in different locations to be compared.",

    "Term": "Absolute Zero",
    "Definition": "Absolute zero is the zero point of the kelvin temperature scale, corresponding to -273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale and -459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale. This choice of zero point is motivated by fundamental physics: for a classical system, the temperature of absolute zero would correspond to a state where all of the particles are at perfect rest, each with kinetic energy zero. In the real world, basic effects of quantum theory mean that this state of complete rest will never be reached.\n\nIn the language of thermodynamics, which describes general systems and their abilities to exchange heat and other forms of energy, an idealized system at temperature absolute zero would be a system from which no heat could be extracted at all. In practice, it is impossible to bring a system into that ideal state. This is codified by the so-called 3rd law of thermodynamics, also called Nernst's theorem: we can get arbitrarily close to absolute zero, but we can never reach it.",

    "Term": "Absorption Line",
    "Definition": "A rainbow forms when water droplets split light into elementary colors, from purple, blue, and green, to yellow, orange, and red. Each color corresponds to a range of wavelengths, and the rainbow colors are arranged in order of increasing wavelength from violet to red. This kind of decomposed light, or more generally of electromagnetic radiation, by wavelength is called a spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is a mixture of light particles called \"photons\". Creating a spectrum amounts to sorting photons by energy and documenting how many photons there are in each given energy range. By a basic law of quantum mechanics, this is equivalent to sorting light by frequency â€“ yet another way of documenting a spectrum.\n\nIf the amount of energy varies smoothly with wavelength (or photon energy, or frequency), the spectrum is called continuous. In contrast, sharp dips or peaks in a spectrum at certain wavelengths are called absorption and emission lines, respectively. Such lines arise due to transitions between different energy levels within atoms or molecules (or even atomic nuclei), either absorbing or emitting radiation at specific wavelengths. For example, in visible light, stars show continuous spectra with absorption lines. The lines carry information about a star's chemical composition. The analysis of spectra is known as spectroscopy; instruments that allow for the recording of spectra are called spectroscopes, spectrometers, or spectrographs.",

The measurements were consistent with the scenario for a universe where the rate of expansion was accelerating. The cause for the accelerated expansion is attributed to dark energy, the nature of which is still unknown and a topic of current research.

    "Term": "Accretion Disk",
    "Definition": "When an astrophysical object accretes matter, unless the in-falling matter is already moving straight towards the attracting object, it cannot fall directly onto it. Indeed as the in-falling object moves closer to the attracting object, the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the line between it and the attracting object increases due to conservation of angular momentum.\n\nIn many cases, in-falling matter will collect in what is called an accretion disk: a swirling disk of gas and dust surrounding the attracting object. From the inner rim of the disk, matter can fall onto the central object. For a compact central object, matter falling onto the accretion disk will have gained an enormous amount of energy while falling. As this energy is deposited in the disk, the disk can heat up to temperatures of hundreds of thousands or even millions of kelvins. Accretion disks around the supermassive black holes in the center of some galaxies provide the power for active galactic nuclei (AGN). These extremely bright objects can be brighter than all the stars in their host galaxy combined.\n\nAccretion disks are found in a variety of astrophysical situations such as around supermassive black holes, stellar remnants, gamma ray bursts, or protostars.",

AGNs have quite complex structures, with many different regions that emit light with different characteristics, and are often surrounded by a donut-shaped torus of dusty material. An AGN sometimes sends out jets of material in opposite directions. While many galaxies have a supermassive black hole in the center, not all are accreting matter and hence not all are AGN.\n\nAGN is a general term that includes objects such as quasars, blazars, Seyfert galaxies, and radio galaxies. The different observational properties of these types of objects are thought to result in part from AGNs being viewed from different angles.",

    "Term": "Adaptive Optics",
    "Definition": "When you look up at night, you might see the stars twinkle. The air in the atmosphere is always in motion, and as light from a star passes through a region with turbulence, it gets deflected by a varying amount. That is why what we can see in the sky is not a single steady point of light for each star, but a dancing, ever-changing, distorted succession of points. For astronomers, twinkling means that they cannot take images of celestial objects in as much detail as their large ground-based telescopes would otherwise allow. Adaptive optics is a way of mitigating that effect. Using either a real star or a laser-projected \"artificial star\", an adaptive optics (\"AO\") system monitors atmospheric distortion in real time. Light that has entered the telescope is guided onto a deformable mirror. Controlled by a computer, that mirror is continuously deformed in just the right way to counteract atmospheric distortion.",

That angle measures how high an object is above the horizon â€“ if you point your finger at the object, and then move that finger straight down to the horizon, the direction of your arm will have changed by the angle that is the altitude. Altitude is measured either in degrees or in radians. An object on the horizon would have an altitude of 0Â°, and an object that is directly overhead, \"at the zenith,\" would have an altitude of 90Â°. Negative altitude values are assigned to objects that are currently below the horizon â€“ there, the altitude angle measures how far the object is below the horizon. An object that is straight below your feet, \"at the nadir,\" would have an altitude of â€“90Â°.\n\nIn other contexts, such as aviation or atmospheric physics, the altitude is a measure of how high a place is above some given reference level.

It makes those objects appear to move on tiny ellipses in the night sky over the course of one year, an effect known as annual parallax. The major axis of that apparent-motion ellipse, expressed as an angle, corresponds to twice the object's so-called (annual) parallax angle. The parallax angle corresponds to a change in observer position by one astronomical unit (AU), that is, by the average Earthâ€“Sun distance, or the Earth's displacement between two astronomical observations performed half a year apart.

Some asteroids have moons â€“ other small asteroids which orbit them.\n\nAsteroids are smaller than dwarf planets (which have enough mass for gravity to pull them into a nearly round shape). They are larger than meteoroids; the lower size limit of an asteroid is commonly set at between one and 10 meters across. If heating by the Sun or star causes the small body to emit gas and dust, the body is a comet and not an asteroid (although the distinction is not always clear).\n\nHistorically, the name asteroid was given to any astronomical body that orbits the Sun that was too small to resolve with a telescope.

Surveys covering small areas or \"pencil-beam\" surveys can concentrate more time observing one part of the sky and thus can detect fainter objects than some wider surveys.\n\nAstronomical surveys may cover specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as radio waves or the infrared, or may combine data from different wavelength ranges.\n\nSome astronomical surveys make repeated observations of the same part of the sky allowing the scientific study of the movement of objects across the sky and of the change in brightness of astronomical objects or the appearance of transient objects such as supernovae. By measuring the yearly change in the positions, astronomers can also calculate the distance of the objects using parallax.

    "Term": "Azimuth",
    "Definition": "In a horizontal coordinate system, azimuth refers to the direction (angle along the horizon) at which the object is found. It is measured in degrees starting from the north and towards the east. Azimuth values cover a full circle from 0 degrees to 360 degrees. In other words, if you draw an imaginary arc on the celestial sphere from the object to the horizon and perpendicular to the horizon, the azimuth will tell you the location of the point where this arc meets the horizon. An object located directly north would have 0 degrees azimuth, an object directly east would have 90 degrees azimuth and so on. In older textbooks used in multiple countries, the convention was to start measuring the azimuth from the south towards the west. Thus, azimuth values in those textbooks would be shifted by 180 degrees.",

    "Term": "Big Bang Nucleosynthesis",
    "Definition": "Nucleosynthesis refers to processes where heavier atomic nuclei are formed from lighter ones via nuclear fusion. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), sometimes called Primordial Nucleosynthesis, is a brief instance of nucleosynthesis during our Universe's hot and dense Big Bang phase, nearly 14 billion years ago. According to our current cosmological models, BBN began in the first few seconds of the early Universe and lasted for a few minutes. The timing is directly linked to the rate at which the early Universe was expanding and cooling down. Earlier than those first seconds, the Universe had been too hot for nuclei more complex than hydrogen to survive. At the end of those few minutes, the Universe was not hot and dense enough for nuclear fusion to continue. After the end of BBN, about 25% by mass of atomic nuclei was in the form of helium-4 (a particularly stable isotope of helium), and 75% was hydrogen. Closer inspection shows that there must also have been small traces of deuterium (a hydrogen isotope), helium-3 (another helium isotope), and isotopes of lithium: lithium-6 and lithium-7. The amounts of each element produced during BBN depend only on basic cosmological parameters, and thus constitute a prediction of the cosmological models. Given that over the following nearly 14 billion years, significant additional nucleosynthesis has taken place, notably in the interiors of stars, it is a challenge to try and estimate initial element abundances from present-day observational data. For helium-4, helium-3, deuterium, and lithium-6, the cosmological BBN predictions agree very well with the reconstructions from observations. For lithium-7, there is a marked difference, but it is not clear at this time whether that indicates a problem with our understanding of BBN or a problem with the attempts to estimate the initial lithium-7 abundance.",

In its simplest form, this theory gives us an idea of the origin of the Universe from its hot, dense early phase, to its expansion over the next 13.8 billion years, to become the Universe we know today. We see evidence of this expansion today in the Hubble Diagram.\n\nBecause our current tools do not allow astronomers to look back directly to the beginning of the Universe, much of what we understand about the Big Bang theory comes to us from mathematical models and theories. However, astronomers can study the chemical elements produced during the hot few minutes after the Big Bang (known as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis). They can also study the afterglow left from the Big Bang, a phenomenon known as the cosmic microwave background.",

The end two stars in the bowl of the Dipper can be used to locate the North Star (Polaris). The fact that the eight stars are similar in brightness makes the Big Dipper especially notable (though Megrez and Alcor are slightly fainter than the others) and it has been known under various names in many cultures. The five middle stars are part of a group of stars moving through space together (the Ursa Majoris Moving Group). Dubhe is reddish; the other seven stars are white.",

    "Term": "Binary Star",
    "Definition": "A binary star is a system of two stars that orbit around their common center of mass as a result of being bound together by the force of gravity. Their orbits follow Kepler's laws of motion and are elliptical (shaped like a squashed circle) or circular in shape.\n\nMore than half of all stars in the Milky Way are in binary systems or part of systems with more than one companion star (known as higher order multiple-star systems). Due to their enormous distances from Earth, most binary stars and higher order multiple-star systems appear to the observer as a single star.\n\nBinaries can be classified into a number of categories according to the observational method by which they were found to be binary stars. They may simultaneously belong to more than one category:\n\nVisual binaries can be observed as two separate stars close together on the sky. Not all stars that appear close on the sky (double stars) are binaries bound by gravity, some may just be close on the sky by coincidence but not bound by gravity. Double stars that are not binary stars bound by gravity can be separated by hundreds of light years in distance.\n\nSpectroscopic binaries are found due to the Doppler shift of the lines in the stars' spectrum as the stars orbit their common center of mass.\n\nEclipsing binaries can be detected when one of the component stars passes between its companion star and an observer, blocking some of the light from the companion star and causing the combined light of the system to look briefly dimmer.\n\nAstrometric binaries are systems where only one stellar image is observed â€“ either due to one of the stars being too faint to be observed or the two stars' images being blended together â€“ but where the orbital motion of the stars in the binary system causes the brightest point of the stellar image to show a periodic change in position on the sky.",

However astronomers do not yet know the origins of supermassive black holes.\n\nThe outer boundary of a black hole is known as the event horizon.\n\nNear black holes the physics are so extreme that time runs much slower (compared to an observer far away from the black hole) and, around smaller black holes, objects are stretched and torn to pieces. Matter falling towards a black hole forms an accretion disk. This can often be accompanied by jets of matter sent out from this disk.
