# Constellation-Guide
Welcome to Stargazer's Club. Here you will find comprehensive data about all 88 commonly
known constellations. This guide will provide information about notable stars, nebula, galaxies,
associated mythology and meteor showers. We are in the process of expanding the Stargazer's
Club, so be sure to return here to see what we've been up to.

Happy Stargazing!
