# Stargazers Club

Welcome to Stargazer's Club. Our purpose is to teach the basics of astronomy to anyone who has
an interest. Our website is currently under construction, but some sections are complete. They are:

 - Constellation Guide: This guide is all about learning the basics of the 88 constellations
   in the night sky. Access the Constellation Guide by clicking the "Explore Constellations"
   button on the main page.

- Create a Star Chart: This section allows you to create a star chart to assist you with finding
  celestial objects (constellations, planets, moon, galaxies, etcetera). This requires your
  geographical location to provide you with an accurate chart. Access the chart generator by
  clicking the "Create a Star Chart" button on the main page.

Plans for the future include:

- A solar system guide: Explore our local star; the sun, and all of the planets that orbit it.
- You'll also have access to comprehensive information about the asteroid belt, our moon,
- moons orbiting other planets, comets, the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud.

Stargazer's Club will eventually expand to cover many more aspects of astronomy. Check back
often to see what's being planned.

Happy Stargazing!
