# Constellation-Guide
Welcome to Stargazer's Club. Here you will find comprehensive data about all 88 commonly
known constellations. This guide will provide information about notable stars, nebula, galaxies,
associated mythology and meteor showers. We've recently added the ability to generate a star chart
of the night sky. Just update your location and we'll generate your start chart. Print it and take
it outside with you and let it be your guide.

Happy Stargazing!
