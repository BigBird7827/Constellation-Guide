# Stargazers Club

Welcome to Stargazer's Club. Our purpose is to teach the basics of astronomy to anyone who has
an interest. Our website is currently under construction, but some sections are complete. They are:

 - Constellation Guide: This guide is all about learning the basics of the 88 constellations
   in the night sky. Access the Constellation Guide by clicking the "Explore Constellations"
   button on the main page.

- Create a Star Chart: This section allows you to create a star chart to assist you with finding
  celestial objects (constellations, planets, moon, galaxies, etcetera). This requires your
  geographical location to provide you with an accurate chart. Access the chart generator by
  clicking the "Create a Star Chart" button on the main page.

Plans for the future include:

- A solar system guide: Explore our local star; the sun, and all
  of the planets that orbit it. You'll also have access to comprehensive information about the asteroid
  belt, our moon, moons orbiting other planets, comets, the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud.

- An exo-planet guide: Learn about all of the discoveries that have been made about planets
  outside of our solar system. Some of them are just too weird to imagine. You'll have to read
  about it yourself.

Happy Stargazing!
