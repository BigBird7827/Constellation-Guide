# Stargazers Club

Welcome to Stargazer's Club. Our purpose is to teach the basics of astronomy to anyone who has
an interest. Currently, this website is private and not available to the general public. This
is due to the fact that it is the development stage. That is, our website is currently under
construction, but some sections are complete. They are:

 - Constellation Guide: This guide is all about learning the basics of the 88 constellations
   in the night sky. Access the Constellation Guide by clicking the "Explore Constellations"
   button on the main page.

- Create a Star Chart: This section allows you to create a star chart to assist you with finding
  celestial objects (constellations, planets, moon, galaxies, etcetera). This requires your
  geographical location to provide you with an accurate chart. Access the chart generator by
  clicking the "Create a Star Chart" button on the main page.

- Glossary of Terms. This is a glossary of astronomy related terms. It provides the basics of
  most terms a beginner would want or need to know. It also includes links to terms related to
  the main (current) term. This section is not yet complete.

- Solar system simulation. This section currently displays comprehensive information about the
  sun and the planets in our solar system. It will eventually also have a full solar system
  page that will include the sun, planets, asteroid belt, kuieper belt, the oort cloud and
  periodic comets.

- Play a Star Trek Trivia Quiz - Be warned, this is no ordinary Star Trek Trivia quiz. It's
  harder than you think. This is a fully functional trivia quiz delivered as an officer
  promotion exam. We hope you enjoy it.

Plans for the future include:

Stargazer's Club will eventually expand to cover many more aspects of astronomy. Check back
often to see what's being planned.

Happy Stargazing!
