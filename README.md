# Constellation-Guide
Welcome to Stargazer's Club. Here you will find comprehensive data about all 88 commonly
known constellations. This guide will provide information about notable stars, nebula, galaxies,
associated mythology and meteor showers. We've recently added the ability to generate a star chart
of the night sky. Just update your location and we'll generate your start chart. Print it and take
it outside with you and let it be your guide.

You may be wondering what some of the fancy words on our site mean. We're currently working on
a glossary of terms with links to additional information. Coming Soon!

Plans for the future include a solar system guide. Explore our local star, the sun. You'll
also have access to comprehensive information about the planets, asteroid belt, our moon and
moons orbiting other planets. You'll be able to learn about the Oort Cloud and many other
interesting objects.

Finally, we'll be adding an exo=planet guide. Learn about all the discoveries that have
been made about planets outside of our solar system. Some of them are just too weird to
imagine. You'll have to read about it yourself.

Happy Stargazing!
