# Constellation-Guide
Stargazer's Club is a comprehensive reference guide to the constellations. It includes, but 
is not limited to an introduction to the constellation and notable stars within the constellatioon,
as well as deep-sky objects and meteor showers. Additional options are planned for the future.
