In one story, he is the son of Poseidon, known for his unparalleled strength and hunting abilities. Orion boasted that he could kill every animal on Earth, angering Gaia, who sent a scorpion (now represented by Scorpius) to kill him. Zeus placed Orion in the sky, positioned opposite Scorpius to ensure they would never meet. In other versions, Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, accidentally killed Orion, and in her grief, immortalized him as a constellation. Orion is associated with other neighboring constellations, including Taurus, Canis Major, and Lepus, all of which depict parts of his mythological story.",
